Work From Home Gone Too Far Rajasthan HC Adjourns Bail Plea as Lawyer Turns up in Baniyan

2020-04-25 20:33:02
This is the kind of news that I need in my life
It seems funny until you read this advocate appeared to argue in a bail case in a baniyan He was then forced to adjourn the proceedings till May which probably means that some undertrial is going to be sitting in jail for more days just because of some lawyer s irresponsible behaviour

AskIndia How to deal with corona mismanagement in India
Hello Randians Once corona patients are admitted to hospitals no communication is received till the patient dies or recovers If the patient dies he may not even get reason as covid in his death certificate since state government are trying to suppress deaths But whole of his family is forcefully taken into quarantine centre Their house is locked and left unguarded Many robberies are taking place due to this If relatives happen to become corona positive they will be admitted to hospitals and same process as above will repeat Government does not have a clear plan on what to do with corona dead bodies If they hand over it to relative they are unable to carry the patients to their home or near by funeral centres due to corona stigmas If there is no nearby funeral centre even hospital would not want to take risk of taking care of cremation Hospital also would not want to use those dead bodies for lab If the family recovers from corona they are not allowed back to the villagesociety even though they are showing certificate of recovery from the hospital They are forced to go in hiding Now even in lock down period cases doubling up every days India will soon have few lakhs cases The mismanagement will cost more life than the corona itself What is your suggestion to improve the situation
2020-04-25 20:31:28
That train has passed long time back Once we come out of this we should elect people who build hospitals and improve public health system rather than building statue
Yeh we are already past that

Special place reserved in hell for whole chaddichandan gang for shoving faulty fingerprint based authentication down billion Indian s throat for minting an extra billion from his shady investment in India Shack Chulbul pandey lied in court affidavit that aadhaar scam authentication works for Indians and for remaining there is alternative A single corona patient is enough to infect whole block when they authenticate using same fingerprint scanner infosys

CovidIndia team how are you dealing with the reduction of data being published by ICMR lately
As a general observation ICMR had been reducing the data on testing being published with every passing day ICMR reports till th April were being published till PM every day with counts of total tests done counts of total individuals tested count of tests done that day and the total case count ICMR stopped doing that starting nd April and now publishes a report till AM daily This report was missing the daily test count The report published today was missing the total case count even The counts reported on covidindiaorg had been out of sync with ICMR MoHFW counts for days now If there are any team members here who are aware of the ongoings please share them here Is there a possibility of malfeasance somewhere in the process Are the real numbers not being released

Is there a possibility of malfeasance somewhere in the process Are the real numbers not being released I do nt see any other reason why they would not release the actual data We are officially behaving like China

Need help with some information regarding the border
Ever since the lockdown started a month ago my father s health condition has been deteriorating constantly and today I think he has hit rock bottom He has Leukemia diagnosed in and Bronchitis and he s been so paranoid about the whole coronavirus precautions I think something has gone wrong with him I think he needs professional help xB He wears a mask almost all the time Inside the house Our house is on the th floor and opens from both sides IDK how but he thinks the air will bring in particles of coronavirus so we ve been living with closed doors and very poor ventilation for the past month We also own the roof rights but since he is afraid of the Air he does nt allow anyone to go there and for breathing fresh air he rarely stands at the balcony He does nt want anybody to use AC in the house because of pretty obv by now Nobody comes in or goes out of the house The last time we went for a grocery run was like a month ago We ve been fueled by just that times daal roti a day almost every day Fruits sometimes He thinks anyone can bring the virus inside the house Ration will probably run out in a week I have no idea what we re gon na do The last time I ate a green vegetable was also a month ago He Does nt allow us to buy vegetables either from the street hawkers or online marts Just when the lockdown started our water purifier broke down eff you Kent for the first few days we were drinking tap water by boiling it and then cooling it rapidly Then he got paranoid that it s affecting his kidney so we somehow managed to bring in a few crates of bisleri l bottle They ll run out soon Someone told him not to put the phone on the ear while talking so now we all talk on speakers or earphones He has had a total of or hours of sleep in the last days Takes a sleeping pill but it only affects him for hours its a mg Too scared to take any more than that Has nt had any fresh air for the past month Has constant headaches and migraines Long story short he is quite bad and literally on the border He cries a lot these days and it breaks my heart to see him like this So here s the thing He just wants to go back to the family house in UP Moradabad He s been having a guilt trip of not leaving the city in time and I do nt know how to get us family of there Is there a way I can leave border into UP without being stopped he also thinks that as soon as we try to go for the border they will lock us up in quarantine wards xB I m not looking for medical help Trust me I ve tried Counselors Psychiatrists NIHMANS Helpline All of it Nothing worked and I doubt anything will It s just the last hope To go back to Moradabad for some reason If this goes on He ll either Die by the end or either I ll commit suicide because you ca nt possibly begin to think how difficult it is here I just need a way to cross the border somehow without being denied or being put into quarantine xB xB Thank you for reading I hope you re safe

Why not contact your local police station and ask for passes to go back to UP citing terminal illness I am sure a resolution can be found
Wait till lock down ends rd May They will not allow you to travel before that for no reason Stuff you need to explain to your dad Air purifiers can filter out coronavirus and you can convert your AC into one using a filtrete Vegetables can be disinfected by boiling them and raw vegfruits should be safe for consumption if left for hours and then washed with running water before consumption Its actually good he wears a mask inside the house since with his medical history he s at risk Also coronavirus may spread through air check michael osterholm

Unpopular Opinion As someone who is not a BJP voter I begrudgingly admit that the centre government s response to Covid has been as good as any central government could ve given
And No this is not going to change the way I vote in and as yet The way Central Govt has brought dissident states like Bengal back in line and has taken the charge degree x coordination the new FDI rule it does feel that they are on top of things The amount people are willing to go through for someone they ve only ever seen on TV is almost unreal and the way many are genuinely following the lockdown in most cities is incredible Of course some of it has been overshadowed by overt minority bashing occasionally daft recommendations and foolish theatrics of thaali peeto But that has been a travesty since some good with a generous smattering of foolish I m not beset with an all consuming hatred for the government to the point that I m ready to see Indian lives lost and utter mayhem to see the government fall I feel that with the kind of support Modi enjoys had he taken a more moderateliberal more accommodating approach to the social complexities of the country he would ve been counted next to the greatest Indians ever ofcourse with caveats Such a stinging missed opportunity
2020-04-25 20:13:28
I was reading old newspapers The st February BusinessStandard has Economic Survey GDP to grow in on first page and Coronavirus reaches nations on the last page That quite sums it all up as to what the government did Both Economic Survey and Budget do nt have one sentence mentioning the virus I then realised one thing people who ca nt foresee month in advance with all data available are expected to foresee the whole year with no data available
You re seeing the glass as half full nothing wrong with that However there is another perspective too
I think an important point that people are forgetting and failing to highlight is that we KNEW what covid could do to lives and the economy but the government chose to delay its response till after half of March was over Countries like New Zealand and Australia nipped the outbreak in the bud while the Central government chose to ignore the advice of medical professionals which came in as early as February th that the temperature checks at airports would do nothing to filter in asymptomatic carriers from abroad ICMR has also said since then that upto of confirmed cases have been asymptomatic

Some questions that come to my mind are the businesses legally required to pay their staff for the lockdown period even if no business has been conducted If a labour intensive business has sub contracted work to labour agencies what are the responsibilities of the business For instance are they required to pay for labour s food expenses during this period Can these expenses be claimed from the govt for instance from the Disaster Management act funds

Hypocrisy of indian govt cutting salaries of employees while ordering private sectors to retain all employees on payroll
When the lockdown started Indian govt made a huge show of asking corporates to not layoff employees or cut salaries Even going as far as sending notices to companies asking them to rollback their salary cuts I will not even go into the discussion around legalityauthority to mandate any such thing But here we are weeks later central govt itself has rolled back the DA hikes of the employees Almost all govt dept agencies have announced donation of onedayoneweekonemonth salary for relief Do nt worry participation is Voluntary though Even hospitals took salary cuts from doctors to pay for a relief effort that largely involves doctors going above their usual duty and tackle this crisis with limited gear and resources In what world does that make sense Do as I say not as I do Hypocrisy be thy name
2020-04-25 18:22:03
Kerela government will be cutting salaries of government employees for next five months All states and central government are cutting corners wherever possible At least salaried people are getting most of their salary with a small cut Small and medium businesses selling nonessentials have basically zero income these days There is no guarantee that they may recover in upcoming days and I fear many will have to close their business or go bankrupt
Yes I was thinking along the same lines With the kind of business ecosystem this Government has provided for SMEs they have no right to bring such ridiculous rules Big corporates can afford to sustain this due to the reserves they possess Small companies can not adhere to such practices and why should they Having said that I think paying salary during the lockdown is fair because it was just a month and a half But expecting companies to not lay off someone if there s no business or revenue for an extended period is just idiotic
We are suppliers to automotive companies you can understand our business has turnovers but profitability is not much It is a labor intensive industry with high overheads As much as we want to we can ’ t sustain salary expenses with no revenues There is no cash flow Are we supposed to give salaries till we finally go bankrupt I don ’ t see banks giving out loans etc easily The labor union is up our ass We are so worried

Should Indian Government recognize the Armenian Genocide officially in opposition to Turkey who always seem to work against us
I cant remember a single thing Erdogan did good Hell in during the Indo Pak crisis i remember Turkey support Pak and later support the claims of Imran Khan on article removal Plus whats wrong in calling Genocide a Genocide
2020-04-25 18:02:32
ELI What s Armenia Genocide
I personally think that its just politics I mean would you wan na piss off a potential trading partner by just particularly trying show their shameful actions to the world which will end up with you gaining nothing but resentment from potential partner Powerful regional power in this case or would you try to play it your way and gain something useful for yourself I understand why US didnt acknowledge the genocide cuz NATO but the fact that India didnt recognize the genocide is kinda baffling Its bad that morality is considered an afterthought by the many governments but I hope that it will eventually change
If you are calling a genocide for being a genocide it s one thing If you are doing it for political gains you are nearly as evil as the people who committed the genocide

This article should nt be in the Islamophobia list Reason I have seen this Live TV A Relative of mine works at Bhadrachalam Temple Board They had only a mini celebration they did nt allow pilgrims Only working staff were allowed Its a ritual that had to be followed and it was done under tight scrutiny Do nt just randomly link stuff to Islamophobia Anyone can write articles that dose nt necessarily mean its the only truth Some have false narrative behind This happened especially after the Tabligi incident and media was also eager to post Hindu violations The Print and Quint had this false narrative so please do recheck with local or other news I understand your well intentions but his is nt a good one to make a point Thanks OP
When Kanika Kapoor did her nautanki people were absolutely ruthless in their abuse directed at her I remember in early March lots of vitriol being directed towards NRIs for being viruscarriers There was also a huge amount of abuse towards one lady who allegedly fled from Bengaluru to Agra after learning her husband has corona virus That news turned out to be fake But there is no mainstream word like NRIphobia or Kanikaphobia The public anger has a lot to do with Islamophobia But I also think the larger public anger has something to do with these facts you are silent about a Foreigners hiding in mosques across India after having attended Tablighi Jamat b Stone pelting and attacks on health workers arriving to quarantinetrace contacts of those who attended yes of these reports are fake but these happened I know of such incidents in my native place Bengaluru itself Happened in Indore Surat Madhubani Bihar Moradabad This Tablighi Jamat is already responsible for a large proportion of the cases in Indonesia Malaysia and Pakistan as well People are calling even references to Tablighi Jamat as promoting Islamophobia In the initial days were nt all corona ve cases identified by travel history to Italy or travel history to China etc So similarly I see nothing wrong in listing the source as Tablighi Jamat for many cases Better than single source If I m not mistaken a gurudwara function was also responsible as being a superspreader you can search and add that to your little list But this was localised to Punjab I m sure if the contacts of those who attended that meet also had returned to places all over the country and pelted stones spit on and misbehaved with health workers people would nt be saying very nice things about Sikhs either The people going overboard with the Tablighi Jamat stuff biojihad etc are those who anyway keep demonising Muslims Why should I a common citizen not be annoyed at members of this group for their actions some which were maybe inadvertent I do nt want to get into the controversy of whether the meets were held before or after Kejriwal s ban on gatherings and all that but after that has been a very poor behaviour I do nt buy all these excuses that oh they re poor illinformed WhatsApp rumours do nt trust the state blah blah There s no excuse for violence especially when it can jeopardize public health I think this list misses all that and pretends that the reason for the anger is Muslims gathering It s more than that

Copied this comment to highlight my point Only from the economic effects There are less old people and way less people with severe health conditions who in our rich western nations are only alive because of the health service anyway of India s population is under they are at no risk at all from CV The median age is compared to the USA Tuberculosis kills people every year in India and that is a disease that already has a vaccine So far the country is in lockdown for a massive total of CV deaths It is absolutely crazy that these countries are attempting a lockdown strategy when children die from starvation every day in India It s completely pointless the extra mortality from CV will only be a blip for India the mortality from the extra starvation deaths alone let alone the ensuing economic consequences will be way way worse Ilovewillsface I think they got enough time This virus is not as dangerous as they say it is and it also has nt caused much damage More people die from accidents other health issues I think India is strong and immune to face this virus without lockdown Why ca nt we just move on and live with it I think we re overreacting and unnecessarily damaging economy and it s affecting healthy non infected people as they re facing job loss hunger recession and depression suicides It looks like Government is not in the mood to remove lockdown till next year How much time does Government need before it can go on attack mode against covid
2020-04-25 15:43:38
of India s population is under they are at no risk at all from CV This ai nt true The second part
How is it that literate educated people like you think that the lockdown strategy is stupid and the virus is nt that much of a big deal because there are other things that kill us How I think India is strong and immune to face this virus without lockdown This guy I swear to God You think you re actually smart enough to come to this conclusion do nt you While all the actual smart people and scientists who advised this lockdown are retards but you you are the man How much time does Government need before it can go on attack mode against covid Jesus Christ so many retards who think they are smart Then there s the comment section going on about how we are not testing enough people Dude tests are not free and the manpower required for testing is different Another idiot going on about how community transmission has started and India has failed It s too late now and complaining about less number of cases There might be community transmission going on in some cities but if it s anything like this idiot is describing looks like we re all doomed The fact that there are not many patients flooding hospitals with issues related to COVID shows we do nt have that many cases wE aRe NoT tEstInG EnoUgh OP needs to read reply Looks like he s downvoted though surprise OP s logic People die of other things all the time therefore it s alright that they die with this because the economy is going down and people are losing jobs
Others r doing it so our supreme leader will do the same Only way to tackle it is by testing aggressively Sadly our supreme leader r surrounded by yes men

Namaste Trump turned into Namaste Corona
Preliminary reports investigation like this makes me scared that the states are suppressing the real statistics and facts and figures this is literally chaar log kya kahengay all over again but with lives of people during a fucking global pandemic a part of me thinks that Maharashtra is at the top of the table in terms of positive cases infections spread because Uddhav Thackeray Govt team are naïve enough to be as transparent as they can be which is a good thing in a neutral world But this very honesty is being used as a beating stick fodder for mockery Look at how much vitriol shade is thrown by prominent RW commentators across multiple platforms The Goa story was hailed as a success but a quick dive into the reports show that Goa has no positive cases since April that s a great statistic but it most certainly not the reality It pains me to say that the incredibly low numbers in the BIMARU states the irony is most certainly not lost on me most certainly makes me very suspicious West Bengal the reports of mismanagement in the state are out in the open now Once again i d most certainly be glad to be proved wrong i really do nt want to say I Told You So this time

Could someone help me understand why some newer celebrities have such hardcore fan following on Twitter and other networks
I ve seen this happen with shows like Big Boss where every night they were twitter trends in support of certain contestants These trends were on top of the list surpassing important national events Today I stumbled upon a Twitter profile of a Big Boss contestant who released a music video a couple of days ago He seems to have a ton of followers who absolutely adore him and do whatever that is asked Like Share Subscribe view endorse defend and what not I watched the music video myself and honestly I do nt have anything good to say about it It remixed and ruined an old Bollywood classic song All that stood out in it where the looks of the two leads Not revealing name or link since it might be against policy I spent some time looking at these fan profiles and it looks like they their life s only mission is to promote him his music and whatever he does Who are these people and what motivates them to do this It does not look like it is PR campaign since some profiles appear genuine I see some posts where he asks them to show him some love and they appear do so no questions asked Its not just limited to this guy I m sure there are many I can understand if the acto is talented and the work is genuinely good and stands out in such cases there is value in sharing such posts but the work coming from these celebs is mediocre and honestly not worthy of any attention
2020-04-25 14:26:42
It does not look like it is PR campaign since some profiles appear genuine That s the point of PR campaigns make enough fake bots post stuff that actual people start imitating them You ever seen how cringy some redditors act in real life If you pretend to be stupid in a group eventually actual stupid people start entering the group and act like that in real life Its called third party persuasion and is the basis of all PR If I try to sell you a product you would noticeably be skeptical But if I hired people who stand by your earshot and praised my products among themselves You would be curious enough to know more Repeat this everyday with new people and you will get a fan following
Ask in they know a lot about this stuff
If it is the same guy whose name starts with S that guy is cringey as fuck His videos are all the craze in tiktok and my whatsapp statuses Girls dig him and some male friends of mine find his voice melodious too🙄🙄

New Delhi Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Rahul Gandhi and former union minister P Chidambaram were among a group of Congress leaders who went on a zoom conference call to criticise the government s move to freeze the hike in Dearness Allowance for thousands of government employees amid the coronavirus crisis I sincerely believe it is not necessary at this stage to impose hardships on government servants and also on the armed forces people said Manmohan Singh in the video posted by the Congress on Saturday We should be on the side of people whose Dearness Allowances are being cut said the yearold twotime Prime Minister Rahul Gandhi who had earlier called the move inhuman and insensitive raised what he called extravagance in projects like the Central Vista beautification in Delhi You are building a central vista at the same time So either you are not doing these extravagant expenditures But you are taking money from the middle class not giving it to the poor and you are spending it on your central vista said the Congress MP The Finance Ministry on Thursday paused the hike in Dearness Allowance DA for central government employees and Dearness Relief DR for pensioners till July next year No arrears will be paid either said the ministry The move will help save Rs crore in financial years and In view of the crisis arising out of COVID it has been decided that the additional instalment of dearness allowance payable to Central Government employees and dearness relief to Central Government pensioners due from January shall not be paid the Finance Ministry order said We can make the point that when you have not cut back expenditure on bullet train on the central vista development those are the programmes which should first be put on halt before you halt people s DA said P Chidambaram a former finance minister Some Rs crore has been sanctioned for the Central Vista redevelopment project to revamp the parliament complex among others Rs crore has been allotted for a bullet train project linking financial capital Mumbai with Gujarat s Ahmedabad by to mark the th year of Independence End

I know these kind of posts are dime a dozen on here but I still wanted to get some fresh perspective on a dilemma I ve been battling with for the past years or so So I graduated in doing my BSc in CS Phy and Math from a tier two city I got a job offer from a mass recruiter but I declined it due to not matching my personal ambitions and generally because I was nt too enthused about my job prospects with them I was first very much into doing my MS in a college with good options and in a field that I felt was challenging and interesting to me But before I could really do a deep dive and narrowed down the fields I got to know that it s a high risk taking a loan for myself when my family is reeling in them worth lakhs due to a new house construction I know I could have gotten a loan for myself kissing my family and the problems goodbye but somehow it did nt agree with me so in short I decided to not pursue my MS degree I took a parttime job working from home with shit pay but I still put up with it and focused on the few positives it being that I was able to start my own savings and pay for my own expenses I left the parttime job last month because my payments got fucked by the guy I was working under he used it on himself and decided to become selfemployed working in a similar field but with pay which is not fixed and depends on the availability of work and how many hours I put into it The WFH job which I m currently doing is in such a field that I m not particularly interested in nor have hopes of it sustaining future market fluctuations But due to a lack of options it seems like a somethingsbetterthannothing situation for me So this leads to present day writing this post and trying to figure out how the fuck am I supposed to move ahead For reference I m only and I know I have a life ahead of me but it seems like all my doors are closing one by one if I do nt take action for the future I want for myself one with financial security enough to puruse my own hobbies and interests freely Because I know in reality it s not that simple to get the best of both worlds Any further clarifications will be provided so please do ask me but thank you for reading this Any help or advice is truly appreciated Have a good day

‘ No Action Has Been Taken ’ Frustration In National Covid Task Force

2020-04-25 12:54:56
Please read the article first Our review of the records of that meeting reveal how having imposed an unplanned lockdown the government was not prepared even with testing protocols to track down those infected with the Coronavirus which causes Covid Confusion apparently prevailed and experts expressed their frustration at the lack of action despite prior advice The records also show while imposing the lockdown the government had ignored recommendations from its top scientists Instead of the current coercive lockdown these scientists had advised “ community and civilsociety led selfquarantine and selfmonitoring ” through their research in February The research had warned of a large outbreak of the Coronavirus in India and indicated that the measures taken by the government until then were not enough The scientists recommended ramping up testing and quarantining facilities putting in place nationwide monitoring mechanisms and arranging enough protective resources for healthcare workers Among the scientists who conducted this research were several later appointed to the government ’ s task force on Covid For more than a month the research and advice of these scientists went unheeded With no scientific strategy in place an unprepared government imposed—with a fourhour notice—a countrywide lockdown which sparked a livelihoods and food crisis among the poor and migrants The government took over a month to even partially consider the advice of its own scientists Gangakedhkar said at the meeting that testing protocols were not in place so far and he would discuss this issue with the ICMR director general and other researchers This was in March The government is so ignorant towards the top institutions like AIIMS They did not even consider the advice of the research until the start of April There ’ s a term called in Gujarati ’ thokam thok ’ The government is doing the exact same thing till date And then MoHFW comes and boasts about how successful the lockdown is There was no strategy till the end of March None

Corona Virus is like a big set of multiple viruses SARS is a corona virus based disease MERS is corona virus based disease So research on Corona Virus has been going on for a long time even longer than your years This new virus is SARSCOV and it got discovered just last year in NovDec Do your own research man xB If one country is actively preventing the release of vaccine I am the PM of India I have considerable goodwill and clout Also this would not only affect my country but also atleast a other countries as well Global pressure trade sanctions etc etc If they try to strong arm us now an year down the line the global community would be strongly against them
Boycotting their products using the people without any law seriously helps if we have more imports Eg Indians boycotting Chinese products Flooding the market with cheap products that mostly homegrown companies govern for exports Eg China giving cheap steel in India Controlling supply of important goods and or giving the same to rival nations These seriously hurt more than you think This has to be done without WTO problems

M wanting to date a F What to expect Can it lead to something longterm
We are both PhD students in a university in the US I am in my rd year she s in her final year I have known her for years through mutual friends For the past four months I have started developing feelings for her and would like to ask her out when the pandemic settles down We are both from West Bengal and have several common hobbies and interests We do several activities together and I really admire and like her Right now I am trying to know her better by hanging out with her onetoone basis I would like to ask her out once things settle down Will it be possible to expect something longterm Does such age differences work in our country My parents are quite progressive but get all traditional when it comes to marriage The reason I am mentioning marriage is because if she does agrees for a date and things do get serious that would be the eventual goal I have known her for years and I like her I think she likes me too Since she s a good friend at the moment she s someone I do nt want to fool around Any advicesuggestions
2020-04-25 10:37:42
Does the age difference bother you At any level Do you guys talk about it Would it bother her As far as your folks or her folks are concerned you both will have to take a stand and assert As simple as that Easy or difficult depends upon you both
Just ask her out and see where things go Marriage is something that you should keep out of your mind when trying to go on a date with someone
Though I admire you thinking from long term perspective it s a bit early to ask the question of marriage because you mention you think she likes you you have nt asked her out yet First do that spend time with her get to know her better what s her idea what s her feelings for you and then probably revisit this question My only suggestion Do nt rush to it Take your time But also keep in mind the girls age in case you want to extend your family not saying that you should nt love her or marry her becuase of the age but more in terms of she could face complications in pregnancy pls correct me if I am wrong I am just saying what I have heard from other women If you plan to adopt a child then the above point on age is immaterial Edit Added point on adoption

Armenian Genocide memorial at the churchyard of the Holy Nazareth Armenian Church in Kolkata

2020-04-25 10:30:30
There s a Sri Lankan genocide memorial in Kolkata too
Kolkata has a small Armenian community who moved to India after independence from USSR
I had absolutely no idea before today that there was a Armenian genocide After seeing this post I went into wikipedia and have been reading for the past hour If you are reading my comment I strongly recommend that you do the same I do not know how to express my disgust towards the demons that perpetrated this mind numbing horror The articles mention that little children were taken out into the Black Sea on boats and then thrown overboard I could not read for some time after that This reminded me of Steven Spielberg s film Schindler s List At I also found that A segment of speech given by Hitler to Wehrmacht commanders at his Obersalzberg records him asking rhetorically Who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians Historian Margaret L Anderson surmises we have no reason to doubt the remark is genuine both attack and defense obscure an obvious reality that the Armenian Genocide has achieved iconic status as the apex of horrors imaginable in and that Hitler used it to persuade the German military that committing genocide excited a great deal of talk but no serious consequences for a nation that perpetrates genocide I now believe that all children should be taught about the histories of genocide at school during their late teens Maybe it will guard our societies from such things happening again I have also come to reflect that all genocides wars communal riots pogroms and ethnic cleansing happen due to perceived differences of race religion or other factors Such hatred will continue as long as these false differentiating and dividing factors are allowed to I do not mean to downplay economic factors or motivation behind such atrocities but the false differences make it easier to target parts of the population As I kept reading it continuously reminded me of my own country at present times Prosecutors acting on their own initiative have used Article of the Turkish Penal Code prohibiting insulting Turkishness to silence a number of prominent Turkish intellectuals who spoke of atrocities suffered by Armenians in the last days of the Ottoman Empire most of these cases have been dismissed During a February interview with Das Magazin novelist Orhan Pamuk made statements implicating Turkey in massacres against Armenians and persecution of the Kurds declaring Thirty thousand Kurds and a million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it Subjected to a hate campaign he left Turkey before returning in to defend his right to freedom of speech What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation it was a taboo But we have to be able to talk about the past Lawyers of two Turkish ultranationalist professional associations led by Kemal Kerinçsiz then brought criminal charges against Pamuk However on January the charges of insulting Turkishness were dropped for reasons not necessarily tied to the case a move welcomed by the EU This is just like our UAPA which allows our state to arrest and jail anybody without legal recourse At a symposium held on April Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned France for its official commemoration of the Armenian Genocide and termed the deportations of Armenians by the Ottoman government in the early th century appropriate at the time Just wow This guy just might be carrying a photo of Hitler in his wallet I will stop now with a last bit of information The American band System of a Down composed of four descendants of Armenian Genocide survivors has promoted awareness of the Armenian Genocide through its lyrics and in concerts On April the band performed a free concert in the Republic Square Yerevan to commemorate the th anniversary of the genocide Chop Suey just got sweeter Also Thanks to for this history lesson

Still confused about ban on liquor
A friend of mine in dubai even took a cheap shot at me saying I Thought u guys were a free democracy Even in middle East they are providing home delivery India is only lockdown country where there is this weird ban I get it it is non essential but it s been weeks Again what are they trying to prevent Seems like something is brewing no pun intended
2020-04-25 09:52:24
Here is the explanation for the ban Liquor and petrol is of the state revenue So petrol is not selling And liquor is locked too States are at mercy of centre Power likes to maximize the power Federal structure is at crisis thanks to Corona
I suspect it has more to do with a misplaced sense of morality in the minds of the unkills in the administration It s a surprise that they have even allowed meat and poultry to function more or less the same as normal groceries and essentials
My guess is possible increase in domestic violence

A lot of bank and payment apps do this Not sure how this adds to security since the apps work even if you deny the request or easily spoof the location
Privacy goes brrrrrrr
Phone State and SMS permissions are already needed for many other applications Google pay will ask you to turn on the location to transact Bank security works on principles some thing you know pin password some thing you have cc CVV loosely OTP some thing you are biometric There are hybrid identities like mobile number etc etc Fraudsters can impersonate few but not all indicators So by adding more elements that are specific for an individual they are making is difficult for fraudsters to impersonate you People should know there is no security with out creating strong identity I m talking about design

How do you all take care of the garbage
I have trashcansdustbins with plastic bags I live in an apartment so we have a place to dispose of them and the rest gets taken care of But I have noticed that some people still only have trash cans and they throw the garbage in it directly and that creates a disgusting and smelly trash can Once we had new residents in our community and they used to throw the plastic bags out on the streets until someone taught them that there was a specific location designed for garbage disposal Yet still many people who have their own houses just throw the garbage on the streets I m glad though that I do nt have to go to those disgusting dumping sites to throw the garbage That s what we had to do when we lived on rent The plastic cans deteriorate very quickly no matter how much you take care of them and the steel ones of an appropriate size are quite expensive Technology has advanced so much but we still do nt have affordable solutions to these issues
2020-04-25 05:10:42
I remember when I was a kid I saw an aunty throwing off a garbage bag in street when we were playing cricket we all got so angry and specifically I that I picked up that bag and threw that bag to her roof top with full force idk then I realised what I did and ran away
Solution is recycling and an informed educated population

Yo stop worrying firstly and take care of your mental health start going for jogging or something in the mornings and dont mess up your sleep cycle like I did during that time Have faith that if you know to code jobs will come eventually whether you decide to join a job or freelance Think of freelancing as an option too you can find smaller work and eventually get a lot of independance as a bonus too Focus on doing software projects or creating value now Indians think of jobs but dont think of creating value for someone through a service or app or something There are many options out there but as a start get your mental health together and check out online courses like Coursera Udacity and the like which have tons of courses to learn from Masters itself is a big gamble during a time like this unless you re a good student and have some money to spare Dont be scared of changing your plans when you are young and doing risky things
Consider doing research in your area till you get admits Consider doing a PhD abroad instead of MS as you ll be able to get past the uncertain times that lie ahead Do nt focus on earning just yet you should hone your skills and develop a unique profile

Two Police Security Guards and Official Driver of BJP MLA Who Travelled to Kota Amid Lockdown Suspended

2020-04-25 03:23:24
what about some action against the MLA that s not going to happen I suppose
So the driver was suspended for taking the car out of state without prior permission Fair response The security guards were suspended for going out of state without permission This again is a fair response After all if you break a rule you are liable to be punished But there are a few questions that come to mind which require clarification Both the driver and the guards are fairly low down the pecking order of authority even if they are government servants They gave been assigned to a politician who is the Chief Whip of Bihar BJP in their legislative assembly So not an ordinary MLA The MLA Anil Singh as a Chief Whip is a person who holds a lot of power even over his fellow BJP MLA s to tow the party line in the assembly Would a driver and two guards who have been assigned to this MLA have the guts to go against him if he orders them to help him out Would nt they have not faced repercussions from the MLA if they did nt help him out After all the man holds a disproportionate amount of power over them Realistically they were left with no choice in this situation It s either the fire or the frying pan Whatever they choose they will be getting burnt It sucks to be put in such a situation
MLA breaks rules prompt punishment for people following his orders hahaha fuck off

First ban ecommerce and then unban physical stores Is nt this very obvious corruption Even in physical stores why are they banning the malls which are mostly organized sector and not standalone ones who resort to more tax evasion and fake goodsmalpractices
Brain dead move tbh I understand closing malls but ecommerce should have been allowed over social distancing saloons what does that even mean how does it even work lol Opening small shops in localities is a death sentence It s going to lead to a shit ton of crowding and either the virus gets you or you get beaten up by the police This govt has taken some good decisions but quite a few brain dead idiot decisions as well

Indians who have lost weight how did you manage the dieting part
The problem is I live in a joint family and all of my family members eat food that high in oil and spices I have to cut down Kgs and as I have been told dieting is the central aspect of it I have never cooked before which I actually regret but I am really looking forward to learning I want to cook healthy diet food for myself Also is it possible to do meal prep like preparing and storing semicooked food for a week Just want some tips on how did you manage it
2020-04-25 00:33:04
The only thing that works for me is Intermittent Fasting and eating around calories I ’ m a girl and about ’ For me calorie in and calorie out is what works I only started working out after I lost the weight coz working out makes me hungry and eat more
Water man It s just crazy how amazing water is If you struggle with unusual cravings even when you ve just had your meal increase your hydration It is hypothesised that the thirst centre and hunger centre within the hypothalamus are adjacent So at times when you re actually thirsty you start feeling hungry Therefore at times adequate hydration may help you overcome the desire to consume something snackable when you do nt need to The reverse worked for me as I tried to lose weight I replaced small snacks with water And water based foods are really good too There s also some zero calorie foods and negative calorie foods but that s mostly just conjecture However sometimes when I m doing intermittent fasting I ll allow myself a cup of green tea which claims to be zero calories As far as modification is concerned first and foremost cut out all accessory food items Biscuits with tea Papad with lunch Do nt try stepping out of your comfort zone too fast You ll just panic that way Make small decisions that lead to small victories And yeah record these victories if you can they re a great source of motivation If you have a medical condition that requires weight loss like hypertension or diabetes do consult your physician if you decide to supplement your diet with exercise
So I ve lost kgs from the start of this year I did a couple of things First I Stopped eating all sorts of processed sugars No sugar in tea coffee no soft drinks and cut down alcohol consumption to of last year I drink chaach to fulfill my cravings for a cold drink The second thing was I stopped eating junk food No Regular pizza burger outside If I feel like eating something I order healthy alternatives to the regular stuff Third I started taking stairs instead of elevators for up to th floor That s all Did nothing special in terms of diet or anything just small changes in lifestyle

Is this racist
Hello guys I m an ispiring author from Brazil Love your country and culture So to the matter I would like your opinion Recently I finished my latest project It s an urban fantasythriller where a group of young people discover they have powers of gods and creatures from various ancient mythologies The major problem I found while writing this was naming the characters so for most of them I named them with something that could reference the god they had the powers of For exemple there s Fiona who has the powers of a shapeshifting witch Fiona being a common name for a white witch in Ireland Also Diana who has the powers of the goddess Artemis goddess of the moon For the one with the powers of Zeus I named Edison after Thomas Edison who had a great deal of influence in revolutionazing electricity But the one I struggled the most to name was the antagonist who has the powers of Apollo Until someday I mentioned it to a friend of mine and she told me to name him Ravi a common Indian name that means The Sun I loved the idea and I made him have Indian ancestry His ethnicity was nt a big part of his character just some background for him Nothing wrong with that right Or so I thought It was nt until I finished it that I became aware of the problem A major part of Ravi s early plot is his job It s how he meets some important people it s how he comes to despise the main character I had written this part before naming him and giving him the Indian ancestry He works at a telemarketing company See the big stereotype now This was never intended So now I come to think of it is this racistxenophobic Should I change his name and ancestry or maybe even try to rewritte the plot with him working a different job What do you guys think
2020-04-24 23:54:08
We do telemarketing in large quantities You could actually get a few people named Ravi with the same job Go on with it
As someone who also writes fiction I do nt think this is racist or xenophobic at all Do nt worry about it so long as it fits with your plot And good luck with the book

If you have a pressure cooker there is a very easy to make tasty and healthy chicken recipe My dad used to enjoy this alot with his single malt every evening For KG chicken you will need onions tomatoes and about cups of water Add tbsp oil or ghee to pressure cooker and heat Add cardmom cumin seeds cinnamon clove green chilli and fry a little Once spices are fragnant add sliced onion and a pinch of salt Let it fry till golden brown Add pureed tomatoes kashmiri red chilli powder turmeric and salt Fry till oilghee separates Add chicken mix it well Add water and close the pressure cooker Cook for whistles and let the steam escape before you open Mix in chicken masala and garam masala and simmer for minutes It is ready This goes very well with brown rice or as it is Sorry there is no coconut in there but it tastes soo good
Try these search terms they are different types of curry Kerala style chicken curry a coconut milk preparation Chicken Kondattam a spicy dry kind of curry my fav Pallipalayam chicken I have nt got the hang of cooking this one but it s supposed to be with dry whole spices Kerala style chicken stew mild white yellow color curry with coconut milk and green chilli not red chilli unlike earlier recipes Sides not very south Indian but you can try making naans or any type of Indian flatbread These can be made with whole wheat or all purpose flour South Indian flat breads are made of rice rice flour A typical South Indian one is called Appam Not sure you would have all the ingredients for that to hand
I d suggest lookup on YouTube Mainly it will help you understand many ingredientsspices to visualize and find it on local grocery stores

Drama Richa Chadha shared an old tweet screenshot of Rishi Bagree BJP IT cell worker accepting that he spreads propaganda for BJP daily which he claimed was a fake tweet and threatened her with a legal defamation case Later it was found that the fake tweet is indeed real and was tweeted by him
Going to be a long story but worth the drama i guess if you are bored TLDR Richa Chadha shared an old tweet picture of a BJP IT cell worker which says that his daily work is spreading propaganda on twitter The IT cell employee claims it as a fake tweet and threatens to file a defamation case But after a few hours Twitter users prove that the tweet was indeed real Instead of accepting his mistake he is now trying to mudsling those people by creating morphed tweets So Richa Chadha and few others shared a picture of Rishi Bagree s tweet on July th The tweet says Dear AmitShah We spend almost hrsdaily defending BJP Ignoring our Family Ignoring our health now a BJP min is branding us as TROLL A little background regarding the tweet on July th Maneka Gandhi then BJP minister approached IT Ministry to deal with abusive trolls It is said that she has given a list of abusive twitter and FB users to twitter India and FB India and asked them to block such users There were some reports that the list included some of the BJP IT cell members And that caused outrage among the BJP IT cell members leading to tweets such like this from rishi notice the date just two days after Maneka s attack on abusive users After years some people found that tweet to be funny and shared it on twitter Richa Chadha did the same Then came the moron Bagree with absurd reasons claiming the tweet she shared is fake and threatened her for legal action if she did nt apologize to him She then apologized and deleted the shared tweet Without knowing the truth as usual bhakts jumped the bandwagon of bullying her and even asked the moron rishi to not leave her wtf Then few twitter users proved that the tweet is not fake and the moron tweeted that for real Proof Proof Proof Proof Then the fellow bhakts came to bagree s help Here s one moron trying his hand at Microsoft paint trying to mudsling Richa and bagree retweeted it deleted later ca nt find the link rn I mean how illiterate and idiotic one must be to not believe the proofs given and still hate people for telling the truth This is how propaganda works guys even if you debunk the fake news and present them with the facts they are gon na abuse you and peddle fake news defaming you Sharing this with you guys because I thought that bagree s tweet of pleading to Amit Shah was funny I mean working your ass off for a party only to be recognized as a troll by the same party minister lmao I would definitely hang myself in shame
2020-04-24 23:11:15
His “ defense ” was funny given that twitter has updated the UI multiple times over the last years “ Rounded DP vs Square DP ” “ my username has a flag in it ” But then who am I fooling Logic and chaddis are opposite ends of a spectrum There are people on his case though so I guess that ’ s fine
The IT cell people are as stupid as the boss 😂

IIT professor develops software to detect Covid within seconds using Xray scan

2020-04-24 22:40:31
I do nt get this at all cases are asymptomatic They would have no Xray changes whatsoever CXR is the least reliable parameter for covid It takes time for Xray changes to develop so diagnosing that late is not useful Further is is this new We already have AI softwares to do Xray reporting for us since radiologists focus more on CT USG MRI and Xray is a very basic investigation that physicians and surgeons can read themselves most of the time I mean I get the need for positive news but what the heck was that all about
I dont think this works A patient with a mild infection cant be diagnosed by this Only severe cases And in my opinion if the case is severe enough for the xray to work the test would only be a fornality
Would this really work in early stages or for asymptomatic cases Ca nt see how it would

My experience attending a protest for the first time as a yo
This was written by me a day after the protest so the timeline will be referred to that way Yesterday for the first time ever I took part in a protest A protest which would open my eyes and show me our country like I had never seen before Despite having a general fear of being in a large crowd and being surrounded by people I for the first time ever felt safe being in the middle of a literal ocean of people I felt powerful not in the sense that I alone had the power to influence but in the sense that my presence contributed to OUR power to influence Walking into the protest I expected a lot of pushing and punching but to my surprise I was not touched a single time I had a better experience being in a crowd at a protest than I did being in a crowd at the Tirupati darshan Despite the sheer volume of people present over lakh the crowd was the most organized I had ever seen Then I realised that there was only one thing that separated this crowd from any other crowd lack of a selfish motive Every person present did not come for their own personal gain but for the gain of the country Be it a crowd at a darshan or a crowd at a bazaar everyone is there for their own personal benefit Even at the school assembly everyone seeks that one extra minute to complete their homework one extra minute to form their lines one extra minute to talk to their friends all for personal gain which makes the crowd at the assembly seem unorganized But at this protest the people represented the common voice on the streets not themselves No one expected to have gained anything at the end of the night Which is what makes a protest so special On the sight of me my sister and my mom a few protesters gave us a word of thanks for attending They were happy to see Hindus taking part too That made realise that despite this being a Muslim majority protest it was not about the Muslims It was not about fighting the government for being excluded It was not about religion at all It was rather about the absence of religion About treating everyone as if religion did nt exist It was not about fighting the government to be included in the list it was about removing the list altogether We were fighting for the upkeeing of the Constitution A Constitution the ruling party does not seem to respect Throughout our childhood in India we were taught to look at religion and treat religions with respect The problem did nt start when we were told to respect other religions but when we were told to look at religion in the first place Today when we read a name the first thing we see is a religion Lakshmi means Hindu Ali means Muslim John means Christian I myself am guilty of this too but today the protest showed me that despite religion being deeprooted in our culture we can learn to look past it A fact public lunching has more than doubled since that is since the BJP came to power The victims of most of these lynchings were innocent Muslims These murders have been left unresolved after the government refused to do anything about it Mob lynchers have even credited Modi as their reason for feeling empowered Any voice of dissent against the government would be silenced by these lynchers Today these voices can not be silenced They can not be killed It s far too late for that Finally the government has received it s most worthy opposition it s own people A government which does not respect it s criticism is no government at all The government is still trying to silence dissent in it s controlled states UP Karnataka and Delhi are facing the brunt of this signs of fear in the ruling party But every act to silence only raises more voices And the unity of these voices creates waves waves which make a difference That day I learnt the true meaning of unity in diversity I learnt what India stands for I learnt how powerful a protest really is I learnt the power of unity And no Unity is not a crore statue As we marched we saw and heard slogans and chants some abusing the government and some stating the objective but there was one chant which stuck with me and kept me thinking about the state of our country Hindu Muslim Sikh Isai bhai bhai bhai bhai Jai Hind 🇮🇳

the hongkong protest have proven that a protest does not require a leader just a belief in the right thing Everyone reading this comment you dont need someone to lead you anymore you go out and make yourself heard
You are so fortunate to have such an experience I also participated in a CAANRC protest held in our campus it was IISc Bangalore for reference Well my experience was nt as pleasant as yours The speeches made by a few people before the protest march started were really good They were about the purpose of the march being to break the dichotomy of the good Science students and the antinational Humanities students and to express solidarity A lot of good stuff which I do nt remember now The march started well All of us were shouting slogans in unison You know all those slogans against the government and the Sanghis etc Suddenly someone shouts Laal Salaam and most others follwed him or her I did nt speak anything but kept walking awakardly with the rest of the crowd I still shouted other slogans along with everyone However that was nt all After some moments some people starts shouting slogans against Communism It all felt an annoying distraction from the purpose of the march I also came to know later that there were some people in the march who did nt belong to the campus That was the first protest march that I participated in and it did nt leave a good impression on me sadly I may particpate again in any other protest in the future hoping to change my opinion Interestingly some days later I saw in the news that the IITB director had issued some rules regarding how antinational activities were prohibited as they would hurt the reputation of their institute which runs on the taxpayers money Around the same time our director also sent everyone an email telling us that freedom is important for developing scientific temper and conducting research So our director had decided to allow protests provided that the administartion was informed earlier and only members of the campus participated in the protests and that the protests were done peacefully This made me happy that despite all that happened in the protest earlier he did nt prohibit protests like in IITB It strengthened my opinion somewhat that IISC Bangalore is the JNU among Science Institutes Sorry for hijacking your post but I felt like I needed to tell this

Mango season is coming enjoy after lockdown

2020-04-24 21:03:08
There are over varieties of mangoes in India Less than are grown commercially The World s of mangoes are produced in India million tonnes Second on the list China only produces million tonnes Despite being the highest producer in the world the share of Indian mangoes in global mango trade is less than that too in the canned form The share of fresh mangoes exports is negligible for India Anyway that means more fruit for us at home At home UP produces of all Indian mangoes AP produces and Karnataka produces so those states produce over of all mangoes Here is some quick profile of mango varieties so that you can know the mango you eat next time by its name Alphonso Called as Badami in Karnataka and Happus in Maharashtra Alphonsos are called the king of mangoes Totapuri The fruit size is medium to large its shape is oblong with necked base and colour is golden yellow It is widely used for processing Banganapalli Also known as Safeda it is a commercial variety of Andhra and Tamil Nadu Dasheri This variety derives its name from the village Dashehari near Lucknow Tastes rich and sweet Himsagar This variety is indigenous to Bengal This is one of the choicest varieties of Bengal and has gained extensive popularity Kesar This is an expensive variety of Gujarat with a red blush on the shoulders One of the most expensive ones Fruit size is medium shape oblong and keeping quality is good Langra This variety is indigenous to Varanasi area of Uttar Pradesh Legend says the mother tree still lives today in a village in UP The house belongs to a person who is mobility impaired hence the name Ambika This is a variety developed from a cross between Amrapali and Janardan Pasand and released in the year for commercial cultivation Mulgoa This is a commercial variety of south India It is quite popular among the lovers of mango owing to the high quality of its fruit Vanraj It is a highly prized variety of Vadodra district of Gujarat and fetches good returns The fruit is medium in size ovateoblong in shape and colour is deep chrome Suvernarekha This is a commercial variety of Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh Chausa This variety originated as a chance seedling in the orchard of a Talukdar of Sandila district Hardoi UP
as an NRI I can easily say that mangoes is the thing I miss about India
India should export more mangoes I live in Sweden and we only get Brazilian mangoes which are absolute shit compared to Indian ones

HalfIndian How do I reconnect with India
Hi fellow redditors I m a young man from Belgium my father is Belgian and my mother is Indian My mother was born in Puducherry in the s from unknown parents she was adopted at the age of by a Belgian couple Since she was adopted at an early age she does nt remember a lot things about India As a result my knowledge of India is very limited I m not sure how I should reconnect with my Indian heritage since I do nt really have family there I bought books about the history of India and Hinduism I plan to visit India in the future and I will probably start with the south of India I m considering learning Hindi or Tamil I m not sure which one would make the most sense for me to learn I have this crazy idea about going back to India even though it seems like a bad move financially speaking I feel like I could at least blend in with the locals something that is not really possible in Belgium What do you think about this Thanks for your replies
2020-04-24 20:45:09
I ll give some brutally honest and maybe unpopular advice Moving to India would be a terrible move Apart from genetics there s really no connection between you and India Do nt consider yourself a half Indian because your mother was adopted from India at the age of Even your mom probably knows nothing about Indian culture as she was adopted when she was so young so she probably could nt pass anything to you You have no connections no contacts not even any cultural reference Even if India and Belgium was reversed in this scenario and India was the better place to live I would nt advice moving for social reasons The truth is your far more connected to Belgium than you ll never be to India so you just have to accept that and learn how to connect and make friends with folks there and ignore your genetic makeup Having said that if you have a generic interest in India you re more than welcome to visit
If you plan to reconnect with South you especially Puducherry or Tamil Nadu you should prefer learning Tamil over Hindi because the latter is useless in this part of India
I too am biracial and understand the feeling of not belonging in either race You will not blend in in India You may assimilate but you will always stand out Accept and appreciate who you are and look for like minded people where you live Don ’ t look for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow as it a fruitless endeavour

A second wave of Corona is inevitable regardless of lockdown length
In my opinion a second wave of Corona will follow unless and until it has been completely eradicated from our country and all international arrivals are rigorously screened This is because regardless of the duration of lockdown India will not have herd immunity Herd immunity is the phenomenon by which a disease s spread is negated through immunization andor antibody immunity of a majority of the population Since there is no vaccine for COVID and antibody immunity is only restricted to those who have recovered from the infection a second wave will arise from the patients left untreated or undetected This second wave will spread just like the first one needing only a few numbers in the start to grow and only spare the ones with antibody immunity Hence regardless of lockdown a second wave is imminent after relaxation unless a ban on travel is still present Open to discussion
2020-04-24 20:34:58

Why India ’ s petrol prices remain flat despite global crude oil crash

Sitharaman would be grinning rising fuel prices also have an impact on purchasing decisions wheeler vs wheeler Regardless it ’ s not the question of levying indirect taxes it ’ s how much and when the State chooses to do it that matters By hitting the taxpayer in the pocket during the worst economic downturn in a decade the State has exposed itself to criticism
On March it increased the excise duty on petrol and diesel by a maximum permissible Rs per litre each to shore up an additional Rs crore In the following week the government passed an amendment to India ’ s finance bill giving it powers to increase the excise duty by an additional Rs per litre in future Greed has no limits Wah Modiji Wah

Online money making
Hello So given the pandemic and WFH as a student I was wondering about the ways to make money online trying websites like Swagbucks and all However while these platforms provide great opportunities for someone in US These platforms are nt very active or cater to Indians trying to navigate them Does anyone have alternatives

Try online stocks and shares
Ignore any advice about stocks or equity You ca nt get rich off of trading stocks As a young guy focus solely on skills acquisition There are skyscrapers with people who get paid to beat the market and they are nt successful half the time
One of the Apps that I have tried is Qureka Which is a quizzing app The quizzes are available in a lot of topics like literature GK etc One needs a Paytm account to which the funds get transferred Drawbacks you can only tranfer Rs once in days and need to have played around quizzes during that time Plus accruing of money is pretty slow The Referral wallet however let s you transfer more

What Does a Mechanical Ventilator Do
The COVID pandemic has provoked the exponential demand for ventilators across the world But why do we need ventilators so desperately Are they the only solution to fight against deadly coronavirus According to Brian Oliver a respiratory disease researcher and an Associate Professor at the University of Technology Sydney UTS the ventilator can decide life and death for severe COVID patients Like Pneumonia in COVID lungs are filled with fluid and pus which makes it difficult to breathe A ventilator becomes the only way to make the respiration process easier by moving oxygen into such parts of the lungs that aren ’ t badly damaged by the virus If you wish to make donations and save lives please visit the following links For international contributors For contributors in India xB
2020-04-24 17:17:54
Please read this lengthy but wellresearched report on ventilators Yes in the early days of COVID doctors used ventilators on patients who had trouble breathing However these days saving them for the worstaffected seems to make medical sense Essentially ventilators are very invasive — it ’ s a tube down your windpipe and requires general anaesthesia Using modified CPAP machines and oxygen masks and even techniques like “ proning ” seems to work much better for many patients

Covid Toes among kids New symptom of novel coronavirus infection

2020-04-24 16:56:40
Dermatologists in Europe and America are discussing a new potential symptom to identify a Covid patient particularly if the novel coronavirus has infected kids and young adults In March some dermatologists in Italy found an inflammation of toes and feet and discolouration of the organ of those suffering from Covid This condition is much like frostbite or pernio which is a condition found among people living in harsh winters in polar and subpolar regions Here blood vessels in the toes get aggravated inflammation and toes tend to have serious spasm The condition was nicknamed Covid Toes because dermatologists found it to be most prevalent in areas with a high concentration of Covid patients in Italy

The real loser in India s errupting Islamaphobia Caste politics
TLDR My unqualified opinion is that dalit political movement has seen the most erosion in the antimuslim appraoch the government has championed Note This post is for discussion If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you If you only have worn out down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind having merit and anti reservation nonsense I will be ignoring you Now that I ve gotten that out of the way lets talk The anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday I didnt think it could be possible but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack And such it has been since day ie the day the elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened I m forgetting where The very day of the results Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day So to begin AntiMuslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP HM and RSS since their inception create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse Now I m muslim And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP Dalits much like Muslims have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular Lalu s first term Maywati s first full term withstanding no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much So yes I do not blame these communities for voting outside their champions for fracturing the community vote But the fact remains that Modi s government has done spectacular work for the backward communities barring muslims We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal From being called Congress Cow it has been jokingly called Prakash Karat Cow Such is the success of Modi s socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth But coming to the matter at hand OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana ie upper caste repesentation is increasing Now Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease but this seat reservation is working against them I m going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this Not a single constituency in India has more than per cent Dalit population which means it ’ s always the nonDalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats To be reelected a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the nonDalits and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament Note that Balasaheb knew this would happen Which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats I am very much with him on this So who is the loser here Mayawati has lost her base There can be no doubt about it The BSPSP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not Why Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP Who else Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many Dalit leaders are few While Chandrashekar Raavan Azad has made a great big splash he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible Ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat all the while forgetting that of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims Here too the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste This is all by design mind you The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity And its working Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes Reading material Why Dalits voted for the BJP http wwwindiaseminarcomsnigdhadhruboguruhtm Despite having Dalit MPs why has the BJP ignored Dalit complaints Dr Ambedkar has the answer India ’ s Most Oppressed Get Their Revenge Narendra Modi ’ s “ twocaste society ” is a facade to hide the BJP ’ s casteist politics Half of BJP ’ s additional MPs from SCST constituencies Edit Also despite having a Dalit President the caste discrimination he faced while President has been swept under the rug Discrimination Against Dalits Reaches Its Peak President Kovind Wife Not Allowed To Enter Odisha Temple Edit again To clarify I m not saying that Modi is doing very good for Dalits To the contrary I find it quite counter intuitive that Dalits are voting for Modi despite the increase in caste violence Years of Modi Dalit Suffering has Increased Huge surge in crimes against Dalits since Modi became PM Mevani Edit More than one commenter has said that it is false that the government schemes have benefitted backward castes very much I do not have any proof for or against this claim I am not an expert and am only summarizing what I ve been reading from multiple news sources to date
2020-04-24 16:51:21
I understand everything you say except But the fact remains that Modi s government has done spectacular work for the backward communities barring muslims We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal From being called Congress Cow it has been jokingly called Prakash Karat Cow Such is the success of Modi s socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth What exactly are these policies
Real problem is fake news Most people are nt smart enough to check facts by themselves
I do nt agree with the government uplifting backward classes and hence getting the votes part Most of the policies as already mentioned by others predate this government Furthermore most of them are either pure disaster DeMo mismanaged policies with potential GST or did very little compared to how hyped up they were swaccha bharat ujjawala MNREGA beti bachao beti padao and the likes existed even in UPA era and were better funded than now Poverty literally increased under modi so did unemployment and income inequality I should remind you that UPA under Manmohan uplifted record number of people after poverty in a decade a record only second to china farmers too which constitute most of the backward people in India did far better under Manmohan What s getting them vote is organised hatred they spread online Indian people are gullible and BJP were quick to capitalise on that People do nt question the policies because they do nt see the government as the problem the media and the IT cell have given people other enemies to blame in trying times Muslims Congress and Pakistan I should add if you think upper castes think any better of the backward ones now you re wrong Nobody s enlightened they just have a bigger enemy for now If hypothetically muslims were removed the caste system will reach it s former glory in no time

Facebook jio deal
Any Experts here can explain facebook jio deal What good this brings to our economy What are the pros and cons of this deal
2020-04-24 16:02:59
Biggest con is data gathering for Cambridge Analytica like services which is pseudo election rigging by targeted advertisements to the public in order to win elections
Not a far fetched prediction as it s quite apparent already Reliance will integrate Jio Mart from within WhatsApp And soon every local kirana shop will be told integrate with Jio Mart or risk losing orders so they will all come onto Jio Mart And shops will discard their POS machines as there is more merchant fees with Mastercard and Visa and customers will be forced to use Jio Money or Whatsapp UPI to pay merchants for which Reliance will charge merchants a lower amount of fees All shopping and transactions will happen in the WhatsApp Reliance ecosystem So many positives and negatives await all
In short Reliance as always is trying to monopolize and kill competition Such deals do the economy good in some sense but in the larger scheme they re detrimental to a competitive business environment If you want a longer economics answer it is here

I dont think this is actually community testing You were shortlisted because you had a recent international travel history Though i hope they move on to actual community testing as soon as possible Wish u all the luck with ur results Do not be disheartened if it comes as ve People with good health have a relatively great fighting chance against this Hope u and ur family stay safe

When all this coronavirus shit ends I wan na go abroad for international studies and settle there permanently Should I choose Canada or Australia Only thing holding me back from choosing Australia is that racism against Indians is high there and it gets extremely hot for a long period of time Is this true I am also planning on getting a permanent residency or a similar visa for my parents somewhere down the line in future They will be my responsibility in their old age and I wan na take care of them Please help Any advice is appreciated
2020-04-24 14:14:11
emigration
Australia s not particularly racist from what my family and friends there say To me it would be better than Canada just for the climate it s warm but no way hot by Indian standards I ca nt think of living in Canadian weather No country will make it easy to bring in your parents btw They are not legally considered your dependents Old people consume more than they produce and governments especially in countries with good universal healthcare systems are quite wary about bringing in older people to become permanent residents This will only get more and more stringent as the years pass
Even if Australia is very hot you ve lived in India so heat is no issue 😅 As for which country to live in that depends on you See what interests you about both places the climate culture friendliness of the people any language barrier food job opportunities for your chosen field healthcare system cost of living accessibility and transport to move around properly in some places it s necessary to buy a car etc Make a list of what all matters to you and decide Edit after Coronavirus no country will be what it used to be There will be change and a period of reconstruction as they try to restore the economy and get back to preCovid quality of life Also factor that into your timeline of when to move

What would the Congress gain after attacking Arnab
I m not trying to down play what happened with Arnab It s bad and we all agree with it But there s always been a recurring question that is asked after any attack Who benefits Why do you think the congress would had carried the attack in the first place Arnab is such a vocal critic who has a renowned base through which he spits fire every night He s funded by the right wing who literally owns most media outlets and is the reigning power In what space and time did they think attacking Arnab would be a wise move Please share your thoughts
2020-04-24 10:49:33
Why do you think the congress would had carried the attack in the first place Do you think every action goes only after being approved by leadership Low level workers take action most of the time without any orders
Who may benefit BJP propaganda machine Arnab himself any congNCP guy planning to defect to BJP soon Shiv Sena if they re planning to quit alliance and join BJP Who did not benefit politically Cong NCP Press Council Editor s Guild Who did not benefit at all no matter who planned it liberal journos and individuals Because it ll be used to justify every attack on liberal journos from now on wHeRE wErE YoU wHen Arnab etc etc
If you present facts to Arnab he wo nt agree instead he d call you antinational If you ignore Arnab he d keep calling you names Best approach is to mock him by exposing his stupidity vile tricks in public

Wrestling with a pig and all that
I think not responding to Arnabs jibes letting law follow its course with those idiot congress youth workers and meanwhile focusing on helping corona affected people and questioning the govt issue would be best way forward for them Hopefully they do that Arnab is just looking more and more like a panicked and mad dog even when he s in the right

Have you tried to get your old job back They might take you in again if you have nt been replaced appropriately Just out of curiosity which industry are you in
Can you code Can you type If two of the above are true try freelancing It will be tough as fuck but maybe you can earn some money to pay your rent and bills
Not fired per se but wo nt resume getting paid till after the lockdown s over Pretty much up shit creek at this point

Hypothetically is anything preventing Indians from faking their caste membership
As far as I know caste membership is most easily identifiable based on someone s last name But if this is the case is something preventing a member of the lowest caste from legally changing their name to fake being a member of a higher caste If questioned you could just say you come from another town so tracing your true origins would be impossible especially if you use a common firstlast name I know this might sound idiotic I m just a Westerner who is curious about the caste system
2020-04-24 06:07:59
No Caste in just your name or certificate is inefficient for society and may be useful for individual The real change must be social change You must read about Tamil Nadu how the changes were done in s onwards The surnames with caste names are not prevalent the street names with caste were renamed equality was preached in school text books However some individuals wanted to gain authority using their caste strength emerged in s which had created few political parties based on caste These political parties needs their caste to be identified and glorified to get votes hence creating ruckus to keep them alive
That s not entirely true and quite difficult to accomplish A particular caste comprises of smaller communitiesclans that you belong too often having a common place of origin Additionally caste s is also based on shared knowledge common rituals linguistic terms stories of common ancestors etc and familial connections going to back to your common ancestor and the village they originally came from This knowledge is often passed down verbally by your elders Some familiescommunities also have historic records going back several generations tracing who married whom and their offspring a communal family tree of sorts You are expected to update these everytime someone is married or has children Your suggestion might help in the shortterm when someone is nt digging too deep Anything that really matters to families arranged marriages for example there will be considerable time and money spent to determine authenticity Another controversial point to be made is that at this point the govt has castebased reservations similar to affirmative action for those coming from disadvantaged castes This implies that in the short term for educational and professional purposes there are advantages to be from lower castes vs higher castes Just my paise
That might be possible but you need to be relatively rich and educated to pull this off Many people associated with lower caste arent You absolutely need to move your residence to another place and never talk about your family You also need to change your job else your old colleagues will know All your old family friends and acquaintances will still know your caste It s a plague Anecdotally I dropped my surname on a whim no particular reason Though it was associated with an upper caste and suddenly many people became interested in my caste

How prominent is the caste system in India nowadays
Does caste still exist in India Do people still know their caste or has it completely died out
2020-04-24 01:23:55
Very Had a very good friend who was in a relationship with a guy Really nice couple Both speak to their parents Guys parents find out that the girl is from a lower caste and say no Both went on a hunger strike and threatened to commit suicide so guy and the girl broke up which was heartbreaking to watch since both were good friends and pretty much cried for months The worst part was that there was literally no difference in the families The way they lived the jobs they worked the areas they lived in
Yes it does and not just in the rural areas although it s much more rampant and obvious there Urban folks try to be subtle but it shows nonetheless when they do so I have experienced it firsthand in Lucknow I was looking for a rented accommodation where most households lay much emphasis on my surname I have a surname which is also used by SCs OBCs and Khatri Punjabis People were clearly interested in knowing which one I belonged to

India s comparatively small package will be its saving grace
Things are a bit bad No country is in a position to recover from this hit anytime soon and nobody is dreaming of getting back to their last quarter performance anytime in the next five years except Amazon maybe But I hear people comparing this country s bailout with that country s stimulus package and it s a horrible metric to be judging a country s fiscal astuteness on At least right side up Turn the metric around The smaller the amount of money the government prints the better it is for the country Every country that printed free money went broke Zimbabwe Iran Venezuela Japan is heading there as we speak America is going to have to go to war to make up for this hit its economy is going to take that s a given Whether it s a literal war or a Trump war is up in the air But I digress The point is we are in a much better position as an economy to recover hopefully at a safe and healthy rate As long as we continue to not print any more free money

How about opting Herd immunity method to tackle virus in our country
I am no expert but I digged into this and this route looks quiet facinating to me We know that our country ca nt sustain long lockdown or else our economy will crumble so should nt we open the herd immunity method to handle this virus in our vast country People in our country has way strong immunity than the west and of our population is in young age Just wanted to have discussion over this What do you think
2020-04-23 22:01:12
We ’ ll turn into the worlds largest graveyard This isn ’ t a normal fever that gets contained via herd immunity
Herd immunity method can only work if you have a great healthcare system for a system as fragile as ours it will lead to great chaos Even UK tried this approach but their infra was saturated Only Sweden has been able to somewhat manage while going through this route Also it is still not confirmed if patients develop immunity to it after first infection
Herd immunity works when you have a vaccine of the population is immune and does not transmit the disease to those who are nt immune For Covid those who are asymptomatic are not immune to the disease but are carriers of the disease Even if majority of the population is asymptomatic they re going to transfer it those who are nt Second we do nt know the long term repercussions of those who are asymptomatic So that route is nt going to work

This is just meant to be a whatif post and nothing to be taken serious This is to promote a healthy debate I in no way support dictatorship authoritarianism or anything like that I am very proud of our democratic traditions however flawed they might be you ca nt deny they have held well since independence and I hope they stay strong forever This can be said to be a case study So Iets start with China which have a single party authoritative form of government And if you compare our economies till things were pretty similar Similar populations similar gdp similar poverty levels etc But in just years China have literally left us in the dust in matters of economy and there is no denying that Now I do think we have done pretty well ourselves but it s not enough considering our huge population The thing is whatever you say about the lack of freedom in China etc etc There government get things done For eg How they cleaned up Beijing s pollution problem with a good laid out effective plan That s a huge flaw of democracy The time it takes to reach a conclusion is often devastatingly slow Now ofcourse I think democracy is the better form of government as people get to participate in the decision making process But here stems the first question Do you think it s good for a country LIKE India Once you reach a certain level of development I think democracy is a better choice but do you think for a country like India or a third world country a country that is just corrupt and have many problems Will democracy be a good choice I mean I ca nt name many third world countries that became developed following democratic principles The West is definitely not developed due to democracy Yeah colonialism I am looking at you I think you need a government which can make decisions quick and effectively Now the whole problem with this is that if we give power to a single party or person no one gets to question them and they can abuse their power for their own benefit So it can go two ways Either you get someone like Mao Zedong Who is a fucking moron or a Deng Xiaoping Who is a fucking legend Literally pulled China out of the junk So the second question is If you get a smart dictator like Deng Xiaoping will you prefer an authoritarian government Now with all this will definitely come a problem of shutting a few mouths and stuff as there will always be opposition to change So some civil liberties will be naturally be curbed in a government of this type So the third question is Will you be willing to trade your civil liberties with a guarantee that the regime will make the country developed We can see examples of this in the Four Asian Tigers Let s restrict it to South Korea and Singapore Singapore had a great dictator in Lee Kuan He changed a small country s destiny in a few decades Deng Xiaoping proved it can be done on a larger scale as well And then you look at South Asia which is nt doing great at all We have Sri Lanka with their civil war Pakistan with their Coup Nepal which is nt doing well and Bangladesh is nt doing well either Also South Korea later turned to a democracy and I think they are doing great So the last question is Will you accept an authoritarian government if it will turn to a democracy later when things settle down Though this is rare So tell me what you think guys I just want India to be a country that the world appreciate Because undoubtedly there is no country in the world that will be as great as India once it is a developed country

No other way to keep so many ethnicities religions and class groups working together I m afraid And no way of ensuring that the Indian Mao does nt kill us all

India s stray dog problem
So I live in Ghaziabad Delhi NCR basically and I am now passed out from this school I went to buy some stuff a hour earlier and these dogs attacked me As I am good with dogs I was able to save myself But it reminded me of something that happened in our school years ago And it really makes my blood boil that the situation is nt any better These dogs have been a nuisance for a long time And before I get hate I want to tell you I am a huge dog lover and I was used to feed strays all the time in my ex society Just think how these kids must be feeling going to school everyday with a disfigured face which was no fault of theirs Their poor parents complained to the municipality office but they did nt do shit Some of us can deal with dogs but just think of a kid or your little brother His first reflex would be to run and God knows what he can do My neighbour comes home late from work every night and he is always feels threatened that one day a dog may bite him and this is the problem with India as a whole we just wait for something bad to happen before taking any action Its pretty frustrating to not be able to go for a morning walk without feeling safe And politicians like Maneka Gandhi who probably have never stepped out of her car does nt know what problem these dogs pose to two wheeler owners and pedestrians I also understand that I ca nt demonize all stray dogs because some stray dogs are aggressive but do you have a better solution And look I am a leftist humanist and whatever so I do believe in equality but equality is a vague term Equality means equality of equals you ca nt go and ask for reservations that SCST gets on the argument that you both are human and equal So do nt give me shit like dogs are equal and tbfh they are not I do agree that they have the right to coexist with us in this planet but humans are the priority and there is no denying that If you think dog life equal human life you should probably wake from your damn utopia People like this piss me the most saying oh but you ca nt do that if a human kills or rapes someone you ca nt wipe of humanity but you sure can wipe out that human In simple words stray dogs are pests that threaten humans and should be dealt with the most humane way possible I also do nt support mass killing but people who think there is no problem I hope you get fucking biten I think people should report aggressive dogs and they should be killed without any protests through injections All females need to be sterilized and all dogs should get vaccinated and stuff so we can decrease chance of rabies As population goes down shelters should be built to keep them in the shelters and awareness should be spread that how low maintenance they are and they make a great pet which is true my dad had one
2020-04-23 19:44:09
The entire problem is created by Maneka Gandhi and until people start reporting this more and create a big issue over this it ll not get solved People are bigger dog lovers than human lovers and are the ones that stop municipality workers from relocating dogs or taking them to shelters The dog population is rising unchecked and obviously catch and release is nt working well at all There needs to be some form of intervention
Feeding strays is not animal love The day self professed animal lovers figure this out we would be better off The stray dog cows and whatever is essentially a waste management problem Clean up the place neighbourhood city and strays can be reduced But this has to be combined with sterilization We are talking about sterilization Finally the dog lovers of India can actually start owning Indian dog pure breds Rampur hound anyone Indian dogs adjust well to Indian climate and are equally sharp and trainable Skip that rottweiler who might just kill someone Get that Indian origin shepard dog
Unpopular opinion Euthanisation is needed to solve this problem

Long story short They forgot to convert UTC to IST The website shows the time as PM on April However in the ‘ tags ’ section the website gives the time as ‘ TZ ’ The letter ‘ Z ’ denotes Zulu Time which is the Greenwich Mean Time GMT now known as the Universal Time Coordinated UTC To adjust this with the Indian Standard Time IST one needs to add hours which means that the creation time is AM April This is the exact time when Republic TV uploaded the video on Twitter

Geopolitics of Bangladesh liberation war Why India initially did nt want East Pakistan modern Bangladesh to gain independence from West Pakistan modern day Pakistan
I was researching on this subject recently which revealed some interesting points about the Bangladesh liberation war and the indo Pakistan war Indira Gandhi government was of opinion that east Bangladeshi parties coming to power in combined Pakistan assembly would moderate west Pakistan s obsession with Kashmir So I need to give a little background Before the Bangladesh liberation war really gathered steam a student protest had already broken our in West and east Pakistan against dictator Ayub Khan The movement demanded the restoration of democracy in combined Pakistan When the situation became too hot to handle the Pakistani military stepped in and deposed Ayub khan It was decided to hold elections soon Now you need to know that population wise the population of Bangladeshis in east Pakistan was numerically greater than population of West Pakistan In the elections that followed that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his party Awami league won a landslide victory in East Pakistan They won almost every seat in East Pakistan awami league lost only seats and emerged as the single largest party in combined Pakistan national assemblyBhutto and his People s party were the second largest but nowhere near majority This was a shock election results for the Pakistani military establishment and Bhutto who had thought that west Pakistani dominance in national assembly was inevitable The Indian government found this result as optimistic for India We thought that the Bengali politicians of East Pakistan would care less about Kashmir and would start an era of better relationship with India Thus as a result in the initial days of the liberation movement India was nt really keen on an independent Bangladesh as that would mean an even more rabid west Pakistan with regards to Kashmir Indira Gandhi government was afraid of leftist elements in Bangladeshi independence movement She was afraid that once they attain independence they will give support to the Maoist naxal insurgency raging in West Bengal The cold war geopolitics had caused Pakistan to join the side of capitalist America and the west Meanwhile in India a Maoist insurgency was raging in West Bengal and East India Indira Gandhi and her government was afraid that once Bangaldesh attained independence the left elements involved in the liberation movement would give refuge and support to the Maoist insurgents in West Bengal which was not currently happening since Pakistan was on the American side As a result members of Indira Gandhi government were of opinion that it was better if east Pakistan remained part of Pakistan Soviet Union was afraid that an independent Bangladesh would be a Chinese ally Before the liberation movement the sinosoviet split had taken place The communist world was taking the side of either China or Soviet Union Soviet Union was afraid that the Maoist section of the Bangaldesh liberation movement would push them towards the China camp As a result Soviet Union warned India against any drastic action in Bangladesh They kept this position until Indira Gandhi herself went to Moscow and held a hour meeting with the top leader to brief them on the ongoing genocide in East Pakistan operation searchlight She also reminded them of their obligation under IndoSoviet friendship treaty It was after this meeting that Soviet Union finally changed their position and sided with India America was afraid that break up of Pakistan would derail the ongoing negotiations between China USA which was being done via Pakistan As a result Nixon threatened India that any war against Pakistan will be expensive for India The green Revolution had nt taken place yet India had a ship to mouth existence where American aid to poor countries like India kept us afloat America used to send food package and other relief measures to India regularly If America had suspended those relief packages and placed sanctions on us we would have been in great trouble On top of those if they had placed more sanctions on us our economic system would have collapsed As a result we had to take any decision seriously

Best you can do is check the employment contract to see the clause about severance But most small companies in India do not have such clauses
Downvote me to hell but what do you want exactly from the company I think they have done the correct thing by informing the situation to their employees instead of going some other route and doing some political crap You can not expect the owners and shareholders to sell themselves to keep paying employees they can not afford Start looking at your options

How does herd immunity work
Does herd immunity mean that if half the population gets infected the other half automatically becomes immune I am confused
2020-04-23 14:43:41
Trying my best bit to make sense of what I read some time back Before you start with herd immunity you need to understand two things Herd Threshold and Rzero factor Proportion of immune individuals in a sample set of population above which the disease can not spread This is defined as Herd Threshold Herd Threshold is dependent on the size of the population Greater the population sample greater the number Rzero typical number of infections passed on by an infectious person A measure of person to person transmission within herdcommunity When a person or a group of persons are part of an immune herd then the probability of spread depends on the Herd Threshold and the Rzero factor Chances of an infection spread decrease within a community with larger density of immune people This can protect those without immunity People who are affected with the infection will be acting as barriers to spreaders They may carry but wo nt spread In disease elimination this can be achieved to eradicate the infection within the community if appropriate or slightly higher than required threshold can be reached
Herd Immunity is a phenomena seen when a high percentage of individuals within a population have developed immunity to a pathogen Because so many people within the community are unable to contract the disease or virus this reduces the likelihood that those who have not developed immunity will contract the disease ELI Imagine there is a nasty virus going around infecting people but of the population is immune That means there is a chance of the virus dying and just chance of it infecting someone in the community As opposed to an infection rate if there is no immunity at all
This video explains it in minute with animation

How will small businesses handle further extension of lockdowns
I asked the same in the live thread before being downvoted For many in this sub owning a business is the deciding factor to a genuine question or a spoiled brat s complaints but please hear me out on this What will the future hold for people in the lowerincome middleclass bracket Many small business owners are weekly earners if that s a thing they have bills rents and EMI s to pay Many have workers depending on them If the lockdown is extended further as many suggest what will the future hold for these guys They might have already exhausted their savings I think we might see an increase in the rate of EMI defaulters an increase in poverty and a cascading effect on all major economic sectors
2020-04-23 14:41:11
The biggest problem are the Emi s though the relief has been given INTEREST is still being charged It is true that NPA s will increase and you may look at higher numbers of foreclosures and bankruptcies in the coming days
Not only small businesses all businesses are affected by coronavirus And new cheap loans are being planned in massive level Many as mentioned will declare bankruptcy Unemployment will increase Many people will be affected Stay safe and avoid credit
A neighbor uncle works for a CA in a financial firm in a company of some people His boss told him on Wednesday to fire guys within the next days and to shift all office equipment from their current office to smaller office which can sit only people He told them to work in shifts of people each and get stuff done from th May This uncle has been given the responsibility of identifying which of the has to be fired since he is the assistant manager He was genuinely feeling very bad because he knew all of them very personally This lockdown has already hit the small businesses hard I shudder to think what will happen if it gets extended

How do you feel about local electronics shops
In general starting a business in itself is a challenge As a consumer I would probably be happy buying on discount from ecommerce but as a human I feel very sad for local electronics shops and stores Say someone opts for dealership of Dell he would have competition in market because of HP Lenevo store and so on Fine till now Then there would be local shops selling multiple brands Again fine till now But then online giants come and sell the same product at huge discount and as consumer even I get excited seeing this but deep down I always know this will ruin the traditional brick and mortar shops I do nt have anyone in my family into electronics business but I feel sad for those who are into this I ca nt even imagine about those who actually have to deal with this and how they are dealing during this crisis and how would they deal after it I just picked up an example of laptop brands but this applies on all electronics items But comparatively in India laptop buyers are usually literate enough to order online
2020-04-23 13:24:25
I feel that most electronic shops have no added value Most of them are just selling boxes and they can easily be replaced by online sales They lack in pre sales support no knowledge of products they sell seemingly not interested to find out either sales delivery time after sales support basically there is none you ll have to contact manufacturer Note that I am willing to pay more if i can be somehow convinced presales that a shop has good service A few shops are exceptions to this But it is hard for them to survive when a neighbor sells a product much cheaper but without service And it is hard to find them
As a kid I was sold a fake PS controller a faulty memory card etc Since then I ve only bought electronics online and the local electronic shops can go fuck themselves as far as I m concerned
online is cheaper

Give Us Kerala Model Over Gujarat Model Any Day By Ramachandra Guha

2020-04-23 12:41:30
How about giving each state its own unique model according to its needs
Success in a state does nt guarantee that it would work in all the state I would have said improvise Everyone is new to this learn from other s mistake and for once stop thinking about religion or any political part
Unfortunately its never a clean choice like that Sure between the two a choice that will never be given to anyone in practice the kerala model is better for overall betterment of the society But in practice the Kerala model evolved thanks to a lot of factors Social movements against caste and for equality enlightened kings international sea trade little interference by the British lack of invasions like in North missionaries with their focus on education competition by the kings and other religions in education as well as healthcare All of which led to a strong awareness of rights learned from the Left which even influenced the Congress a good dose of capitalism when it comes to investment in education and healthcare the opening of the Gulf and later other countries to skilled and unskilled malayalees who send money back and so on Land reforms were another It also has its negatives when it comes to the left s inability to be a constructive opposition too many strikes and hartals and an earlier strong opposition to capitalism which they have mostly abandoned Gujarat does not have any of those advantages but what it has is a good number of highly entrepreneurial people who have over time because very strongly communal a huge tribal population that has not benefited and which proponents of the Gujarat model actively try to ignore or downplay Most states of India are not in a position to adopt either model But they can pick and choose and try to implement some parts Goa where I live now is a different example Little state but without the massive social reform movements etc but with the influence of Portuguese and thanks to tourism from the hippie days an openness to the world However the lack of deliberate social reform movements still has a strong impact which is easily visible among a minority of the population as strong hostility to other communities hostility to tourism to any outsiders and despite the comfort with western attire and skin show an inability to think of people unlike them as their equals Remember that all this affects a minority and a visitor is unlikely to see any trace of these

I have realized how deadly of a tool Twitter has become for people in India to share their extremist agendas Especially after the Palghar Lynching case People seemed to be more interested and invested in what religion the assailants were a part of rather than the fact that people were taking the law into their own hands I have seen this many times on Twitter when it comes to some sort of crime or injustice the first question people would ask on Twitter or try to find out is What religion do they believe in I do nt use Twitter that often but when I do check it something of this sort is always trending It baffles me that people could actually be this braindead Everything is about religion now and its sad

Although the news is good low pollution can also have its downsides I can imagine how this must be devastating for those who are studying atmospheric sciences because of how the sudden drop in pollution can cause huge problems in their computational models Just a few weeks ago two postdoc researchers from the Ecological Department Meterology and Atmospheric Sciences reached out to us at the computer science department We helped them develop sophisticated models in Matlab and launched a weather baloon to capture data about the pollution levels Assuming that these researchers knew what they were looking for we helped them implement everything they needed but as it turns out they were looking to triangulate the position of all the files we store in clouds That s when I told them that they re not physically stored in the cloud but only virtually This whole endeavor turned out to be a huge waste of time I told my parents about this and my father got really furious and beat the everloving shit out of me with his bamboo cane for wasting precious years in college on a useless project but that s how research can be sometimes I guess everything has its ups and downs

The lockdowns will lift once the whitecollars stat loosing their job
I read this line wrt US on twitter today Do you not think the situation in India is going to worsen more because of lockdowns than the coronavirus itself And obviously everything going wrong because of continued lockdowns will aid to coronavirus spread Middle class families will soon give up on staying home They just ca nt continue People are loosing jobs Companies are withdrawing job offers even from IITs Do you not think low number relatively of cases in India has kept everyone from understanding seriousness of situation and people have slowly started to or will act irresponsible
2020-04-23 09:49:01
You got the context wrong Trump and Republicans are urging to lift the lockdown in the states There the federal government is against the lockdown People are against the lockdown but some states are for it And they are nearing million infections so there isnt much one can achieve with prolonged lockdown Here the states are urging center to extend the lockdown We dont have facilities to treat a million infected States cut down the salaries and some states dont even have money to pay salaries for the month of June Still they are chosing to extend the lockdown
The thing about this pandemic is we will still shit on the government for endangering lives by lifting the lockdown Do you think any government will be appreciated for focusing on economic stability at the expense of public health If the lockdown is lifted hospitals will be overwhelmed and healthcare professionals will be affected If more children fall sick because schools reopen who will the parents blame I think a lockdown is one of the more prudent things a government can do Because ultimately they will anyway be held responsible for a public health disaster

TL DR Gujarat has decided to decrease number of test per day to from To avoid being No in Corona virus tally xB Google translation of relevant parts The Gujarat government obsessed with betting on becoming the number one state in India has now realized that Gujarat will become the number one state in India with the highest number of positive cases even if the corona positive cases are not brought under control Therefore it has been decided that tests will be conducted in Gujarat within the limit of per day The speed of testing has been increased in Gujarat for some time now and hence the number of positive cases has increased And now it has been greatly reduced over the last two days At one time around tests were conducted in the state in hours but now the figure has halved This is due to the recent decline in the number of new positive cases

2020-04-23 06:44:37
Good work but I would nt consider Kasaragod urban It has relatively higher population density but the urban area is relatively small I hope this serves as a wakeup call to local politicians and interested parties to improve healthcare facilities in the district It has most of the basic facilities but we have to go to Mangalore or Manipal for most advanced treatments
Read this along with the fact that Kasargode is one of the districts with low GDP in Kerala and heavily depends on Mangalore for healthcare facilities

Minorities too are fed up with this facade of secularism

2020-04-23 02:23:29
Idk what it is about India that just never shook off the religion Throughout literally every point in history there s been religious backing This facade is probably the most comical one because more than most other times in India history religion is influencing politics and hindering progress
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are much better options Even though secularism was one of the fundamental principles of Bangladesh ’ s original constitution it was deleted in by General Ziaur Rahman Islam was declared the state religion in Not sure if its amnesia or convenient ignorance Whole example of Bangladesh and hindu exodus that followed defeats this article Author can use a copy of Lajja
Is this author a first grade moron How do such people manage to get published in newspapers First para The socalled high and impregnable walls between state and religion are now collapsing in India Slogans like “ goli maro ” and “ Hindus are under threat ” are catching the people ’ s imagination So let us be frank we are losing patience with Nehruvian secularism This absolute buffoon do they really think goli maron and hindu khatre mai hai are Nehruvian slogans How is Nehruvian secularism to blame for this These slogans and thought processes are specifically of those people who DO NOT believe in secularism If secularism was the law of the land such slogans would never have been tolerated in the first place In contrast it is this hindu rashtra gaandupanti which not only tolerates this bullshit but encourages and fosters it Does the Muslim community in India really think that a Hindu rashtra is going to be liberal and tolerant in nature

2020-04-23 01:21:23
This reads like a very subtle shitpost
I love her so much that I m even ready to get circumcision for her Firstly is that a thing you ll actually have to do Yikes bro Secondly as a fellow atheist it sounds to me like you re prepared to sacrifice a whole lot of your values because you re scared of how religious nuts would react to your decision While you re prepared to lop body parts off will the girl be prepared to walk away from her family if they do nt accept you Will she be open to registering a police complaint if they force her in any way Will she walk out of the colony of relatives and stay with you Dank memes and all is very good All that means is that she will show an open mind in private Coming out in public and going against a community is quite another thing Please try and make sure you do nt skin the pig before you know for sure if the level of commitment is equal both ways Better play out all these scenarios with her in private before you go public Thirdly a personal opinion Marriage is stupid I ve been with the woman I love for years We are nt married If you both want to live together just start living together Throwing a big party for everyone and binding your loved one in a contractual obligation is not a necessity If you re already okay rejecting societal norms and following your own logical reasoning then why stop at atheism Why not make life even simpler Do nt put so much importance in a legal agreement which is all marriage really is Lastly if you do get snipped please share an update
Well you may be an atheist like the rest of us prolly here but you could start by maybe showing a bit of respect and sensitivity for her beliefs when especially when introducing someone you love to a group of strangers So why dont you do that first and then ask us what we think Maybe you wo nt get lynched by her relatives as you mention smells a fish here

Is antidalit antiwoman antiminority reporting approach working against the Saffronist Or is it only making them powerful everyday If not is nt there a different way for it
To all Ever since this govt has come to power people have been calling out for its anti dalitwomen minority stance But this has only furthered their image and has strengthened their resolve to spew more and more venom on the country Is nt it high time to rather focus our time spent in social media to rather exposing the misdeeds on economical front It may not sound appealing and it s slow But as a matter of fact it is lot more effective Remember how much of a problem Rafael was Alas they soon turned it into nationalism remember Pulwama and we forgot everything about questioning Rafael So let s focus of Economic exposures of this govt and only then it s control can truly come to the hands of the people as our constitution makers had envisaged We ca nt expect media to do the job we need to crowd source it by pooling our own individual talent Should nt we What say
2020-04-22 23:00:24
The observation seems right to me Organizations like Saffronists groups etc are getting advantage of conservative nature and tendency to avoid change in society Also it gives them an opportunity to secure their dominant position in society in this case dominant position of majority male or the upper castes Major issue is that such organisations are controlling the authority in power the government So the idea of focussing on economic drawbacks can actually expose the lies and false promises of government GDP of in high unemployment no substantive initiative for increase in manufacturing sector and also Investment rate is low of GDP with no increase in growth rate of exports What exactly are they trying to do economically What have they actually done

2020-04-22 21:22:08
If nothing helps you can strip charging cable remove the Jack and connect charger wires directly to the board inside Your Laptop will have to stay stationary on a table in this scenario but it should work Male female jack docking is just for convince on the basic level it should work if you solder the wires directly Assuming when you say charging port broke it meant it physical broke
Try asking your neighbours to lend you their laptop everyday for few hours That ’ s what I would have done
I ve seen this issue in a few Dells and HP s Usually a plastic flap holds the female port in place and that has broken inside thus pushing the port further in Planned obsolesence if you ask me If you have a screwdriver set look up ifixit or any number of YouTube videos so you can open the bottom section to expose the problem A little bit of superglue and a donor plastic piece like a toothpaste cap etc can be used to glue the port in place and add additional structural support Once secured you can close the laptop and go back to using your computer like normal Very important Make sure to take antistatic measures if possible while carrying out Try to make sure you have a decent backup on hand incase of catastrophe Best of luck buddy

I am trying to understand why the balance of power has shifted SO much The loudest voice is currently that of the BJP s supporter base The general public that could swing both ways is on the right side of the political spectrum because the voice from the BJP s once strongest opponent has been muted internally externally I do understand the dynamics of weak leadership maybe party infighting also social media and media bias in general however with the amount of events that have gone down riots protest mob lynchings etc a little peep could have come out from the Congress that would have been heard by the masses
2020-04-22 20:58:06
Congress is nt evolving with time When Shashi Tharoor entered politics he took to social media platforms and was one of the most followed leader on twitter but the old horses of Congress rebuked him for that Cut to and ever since then BJP took hold of that space and undertook relentless campaign against opposition in which they have stooped so low as to making personal remarks against any and every leader I and many more people like me even if they hate BJP to the core would nt make any objectionable remarks against Modi s wife but that does nt stop the right wing followers from furthering their vilification campaign so technically you just ca nt match their level of propaganda because if you do end up coming down to their level to defeat them they still win Congress is nt willing to change its leadership and that has just continued to cost them everything LS elections were a shitshow for them because in a competition of Rahul vs Modi you ca nt expect a person on fence to crossover towards Rahul courtesy partially his own goof ups and partially the edits the IT cell makes to make him look much more stupid than he actually may be Their wins in assembly elections have all been because of the state leaders but even there they managed to fuck up by sidelining the likes of Pilot and Scindia just because they ca nt think beyond their veteran leaders I m sure there are many more reasons but these are what I could think of Obviously some or even all of my opinions may be wrong but this is my understanding of the situation
Only an online war against BJP IT cell could bring in any change
Congress has no head Ever since Sonia G got ill and put her son in charge it has gone down in terms of power and even in voice The once strong party that ruled the majority has been reduced to mere crackles that you hear every now and then Veteran leaders who have experience and ability to lead are being shunned behind the leadership The son does nt have experience and has never really been in charge of affairs up until recently He has been contesting elections from Amethi which is by far one of the worst or the worst performing constituency in the country He really was nt groomed to lead the party from the getgo So now you have a nobody who s where he is because he s the boss kid Other than that he has no credentials no track record no experience The Congress has folded due to their own incompetence and poor decisions It s sad really

Someone is trying to get rid of evidence I have some info having worked in a bank Villagers are manipulated to part with Aadhar identity documents to create untraceable bank accounts and debit cards Money via money laundering crime cyber crime is flushed out through these bank accounts and debit cards
All the cards are non EMV most probably the bank issued them as part of some campaign never handed over to cardholder and now destroying the inventory as they have all become inactive We once burnt a lot of cheque books as they had become unusable due to CTS compliance norms

Heh I mean yeah better than USA Modi is doing better than trump We lockdown the whole nationwith schools and colleges when the cases across the country were i mean Italy did it when cases became k trump has not even done it till now Government acted fast good This lockdown and all is to flatten the curve not put pressure on hospitals and stop fast spread of coronavirus and which is happening and is great kudos to government but what is their plan to defeat coronavirus Are they going to test and quarantine the whole country like South Korea did which I think is impossible given the size of the population Or are they going to have lockdown till the vaccination is available Which I do nt think so people will agree to and the protests from poor might even break out So what is the strategy to defeat coronavirus What is the strategy ahead And for lockdown I think it should be more strict the red zone areas Bring army to control in the parts At least incidences like indore video where they were beating doctors with stones who were there to test them wo nt happen because of that Tldr Government acted fast We are in lockdown to flatten curve not to defeat coronavirus What is strategy ahead Bring army to enforce stricter lockdown in red zone areas

Modi s approval rating improves as Covid outbreak continues

2020-04-22 18:58:01
See dude nothing is going to hamper Modi s popularity in India People on reddit have no idea how much he is loved by the general Indian public The Indian public dances on this man s statements He says Janata Curfew lo and behold not a single soul comes out of their homes He says beat utensils in balcony people do that he says light diyas people make it fucking diwali You understand how deeply rooted modi and BJPs idea of hindutva is in our society And if you look at it from the other side which other leader has proactively taken up interests of the general hindu population which accounts for over of the votebank Just look around in your social media you will find even your own family friends colleagues support Modi s idea of India and these people would be India s most educated people so you can guess about what less educated ones will be thinking Modi is here to stay whether we like it or not because the masses want him
The most problematic figure in this image is not the increase but how high the approval rating are In a democracy the approval rating should be minimally positive so that the government can not afford leniency in their work Moderate approval rating are conducive of rise of alternative leaders and showcase healthy functioning of media and democratic institutions
What is the age range of modi supporters can anyone tell It s mostly old people uncles and aunties right Is nt india supposed to be a young nation with one of the highest number of young people hindutva or no hindutva I do nt think young population will support him without jobs

What is the reason India is not able to ramp up its testing for Covid
I am quite a noob afaik is that we are nt running short of swab test kits and even a Indian company Mylab is claiming to produce lakh test kits in a week But the main problem is of antibody test kits which we have to import from other countries Now Why India is not able to get sufficient antibody kits is it due to shortage of funds less seriousness of this pandemic or some other reason How Maharashtra government has been able to test more compared to other states How are they able to procure test kits more compared to Madhya Pradesh or other states
2020-04-22 18:42:32
Antibody tests kits are available but these are mostly Chinese issue with these is that quite a few of them are not working properly Govt procurement is taking time some states are moving faster than others
For testing to ramp up medical bodies like icmr need to accurately determine the accuracy of the test results With bad accuracy more testing will lead to a disaster

Effect of oil price drop in india
So we know that oil price per barrel comes to negative for WTI That means they are giving away money to take away the barrels It is also learned that all the petrol pumps and other oil storage facilities in india are almost at full capacity So is there any way to gain as a nation from this historic incident
2020-04-22 12:59:31

Anyone on this subreddit appearing for any upsc interview prelims or any other upsc exam this year Do you think it will be possible to hold the exams as they were scheduled or chances of a delay are high Also has this pandemic disrupted your preparation
2020-04-22 12:26:40
MoS statement no decision until may rd Personally UPSC is a bitch and will take the exam on st Pending interviews I ’ m glad I ’ m done but pre wont wait for the deferred interviews
There s a chance that UPSC will postpone prelims Ca nt say the same about the interviews All the major centres such as Mumbai Pune Delhi Indore etc are going to be under some form of restriction even till midMay easily with the intensity of rising cases if not lockdown Date April Public transport might not be available at the time of exam buses or trains at least Some states such as Telangana have increased their lockdown to even th May And since the decision is to be taken around rd or th May for an exam of this scale they have to inform people well in advance by that time most restrictions would be there in place anyway so high probability of prelims getting postponed Going by the manner in which they re postponing even the notifications for various exams such as Medical services CAPF etc they too are deliberating for a new date for the exams For interviews they may be conducted within a fortnight of travel restrictions lifting as they do nt require mass assemblymovement of people
I think they ’ ll delay Any past record of the commission has little importance because these are unprecedented circumstances

Most likely yes
Do nt buy anything that s not a lot of money from AliExpress There is no guarantee or after sales support If it stops working after days usage is there an India support where you can take it to It will be held at customs in Kolkata for several daysweeks Quality will alway be questionable due to no stakes involved for the seller Unless k is an amount that is pocket change for you my advice would be no

I m a young guy born to a typical Indian middle class family Most of my relatives conflate psychiatry with sorcery Their thoughts sometimes are repulsive I ve for a while now suffered from selfloathing This detestation of who I am manifests in my actions I ll sacrifice my desires to please others because there s an ingrained feeling that I m worthless It s this irrepressible desire to appease others That craving for approval maddens me I find no joy in my achievements because I tend to compare myself with others It s indubitable that there ll always be people more successful than us Intellectually I understand it but unable to internalise it My acquaintances encourage me to utter affirmations But they ve been sterile Utterly ineffective My passiveaggression repels me Until not too long ago I was nt aware of my tendencies A good samaritan sat me down and elucidated what I was suffering from I started dispassionately observing my behaviour and I ve sensed a pit in my stomach when I do nt receive the approval I crave I m encouraged to love myself But it s a cryptic expression I ve watched countless videos by these soidisant motivators The more I watch them the more I hate myself I ve been encouraged to visit mental health professionals But I can not at this stage I ve poured my heart out More often than not I utter what others want to hear It s clear why I d do that That ephemeral thrill that I ve been approved drives me to do that I hate it
2020-04-22 11:58:36
Where do you think this feeling of worthlessness stems from
Consult with a professional who can address your issues You are asking a bunch of youngsters who themselves are barely mature enough to figure out their own life
There are books various resources on self esteem or mental health scientific research behind them Eg Psychology today the school of life The thing is look for resources whose creators have academic background in mental health science So called youtube motivators like Tony RobbinsSandeep maheshwarithe secret etc know marketing more than psychology They do more harm than good

Should Journalists Be Out Covering Stories During Pandemic
What do you think days ago over journalists in Mumbai test positive What do you think is okay What do you think is not okay In my opinion it is not that much important as the administration is releasing the information frequently regarding covid Moreover excessive reporting on pandemic is creating an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty
2020-04-22 10:49:17
We definitely need reporting from different sources so that we know whats going on and don ’ t get biased information in anyone ’ s favour The only thing is that the journalists need to be briefed in how to navigate these circumstances safely and some measures should be taken to minimise their contact with potentially affected people Another thing is I suppose that other incidents have not stopped happening because of the pandemic so journalists do also need to make sure that other important stories are not being missed because of the lockdown Considering how flooded all news sources seem to be with coronavirus content though this might need some work
If reporting is not done then how will anyone know what actually is going on Government cops and rule breaking elements will have free reign to do whatever they want Journalism is a very important tool for people stuck inside their own homes to stay abreast of the actual situation outside and to keep everything in check
Should Journalists be out covering stories during an War The problem lies in adequate protection used by journos during pandemic They would nt stand up in a hail of bullets if reporting in a war zone even when reporting from battle fronts Thus adequate caution needs to be exercised during a pandemic too

Anyone know if netmeds is still delivering
My parents are in Goa and have run out of their medicine I d like to help them out and buy some online and ship to them Any tips on using netmeds I m in the US but I can try to get their phone number and stuff for OTP Not sure about payment I m guessing my US card wo nt work but if you have suggestions on the easiest way to do this I would really appreciate it
2020-04-22 08:58:15
Buddy before you place an order take a look at shipping methods for whatever website you used I had placed an order with netmeds before the lockdown began th March was shipped with Fedex and it still hasn ’ t been delivered fedex says they don ’ t know when services will resume If there ’ s a local delivery platform use that maybe something like dunzo courier services are still effected all over the country Edit I ’ m in Pune so that might be making things worse so check if services are working where your parents live
mgcom healthmugcom medlifecom are delivering as per my personal experience But lots of items are out of stock and deliveries may take inordinately long or even get cancelled after making you hold for several days
In Goa it would be better to buy from a medical store or pharmacy as they call it there They have always been open all these days

How effective is baba ramdev s herbal sanitizer
Saw a status post on family WhatsApp which says herbal ones can be used instead of alcohol based Some googling got me this which says the method for creating herbal sanitizer is as follows xB xB Making herbal hand sanitizers Baba Ramdev further shows how one can make an Ayurvedic hand sanitizer at home on India TV Through this you can make a hand sanitizer to avoid coronavirus After thorough research by Baba Ramdev this domestic and Ayurvedic hand sanitizer has been declared authentic They say that it is absolutely herbal and it does not have any side effects Have a look at how to make a home hand sanitizer Ingredients liter water neem leaves basil leaves grams alum grams camphorAloe vera xB Procedure First put grams of neem leaves in liter of water After that add basil leaves and boil them well in water Now put aloe vera in it When the water boils well and about to mL of liter is left then add camphor and alum in it xB Copied from the site mentioned This is exactly the English version of the WhatsApp status which was in Hindi xB So does thing actually work If not then this BS can be more dangerous as it gives a false sense of security and will actually prevent people from using alcohol based sanitizer xB EDIT Elders must be respected in the group k chakar mein bc kisi ko bol be nhi sakte ki ye chutiyap hai Inke chakkar mein baki ki lag jaye gi

if Alcohol content Sanitzer Else Fuck off
it might work against bacteria but to disrupt the viral envelope we need alcohols or similar compounds in them that too in higher concentration about at least if i remember correctly
Sanitizer without alcohol means it is nothing but juice to be applied on skin that does nothing apart for giving you a false sense of disinfection

An honest question needing an honest answer Would you leave
Ok so when the Covid infections in India are adding up by cases per day and expected to even grow further and also not knowing what exactly will happen post rd May and how things will pan out after that in relation to India ’ s preparedness infrastructure hospitals etc if you had the option to leave the country would you do that I know this depends if you have direct family members in India or most or all of your family members live abroad What do expats do in this case Just curious to know what people think
2020-04-22 07:55:46
At this point of time I am scared to leave the house forget leaving the country I do nt want to sit in a metallic tube feet above the air with other people not knowing who is infected and who is nt Second there is no point leaving at the moment since almost all countries have sealed there borders and rightfully so They have to save their own people first and so should we Third while I am not a doctor a dear friend is working at a Covid facility in one of the worsthit areas and according to him social distancing and isolation is the key to breaking the chain of transmission Even if I am asymptomatic it is my moral duty to not spread the disease to someone whose health might be adversely affected by it
No We have it easy here Most developed countries are a death trap now
No I wo nt leave Firstly there are travel risks involved you could get infected and infect your family if you decide to go meet them Secondly every country is struggling with the infrastructure for combating COVID not just india Finally God forbid if I get infected I would like to be treated as a citizen in India rather than being treated as immigrant or brown

Covid Lockdown Grocery Stores Timings and social distancing
What crazy person has made the rules regarding store timings in Pune MH Why are they closed for majority of the time through out the day If stores are open only for short times that would only make social distancing worse as more people would be forced to go out at the same time STORES SHOULD BE OPEN HOURS Or at least longer hours than usual That way less people will be present at any given time Like everywhere in the world more people have been employed for deliverers and stores are open for MORE HOURS
2020-04-22 07:10:08
The same people who made decision on demonetization Policies are being made on WhatsApp forwards these days
The intention of the lockdown is for the govt to demonstrate their powers on you like a school principal does on students Look at their actions in context of this and not in context of social distancing
It s the same idiot who did it in Mumbai Trying to argue with them is pointless On the contrary the grocery shops should be forced to be open the entire day or as long as possible so that the crowd is diluted

Releasing a Palm Civet
Hi All In the last few days me and my family have had these curious nocturnal visitors We initially thought they were some sort of wild cats We were to be proved wrong soon enough and we know them as palm civets Palm civets are a strange bunch of mammals with tails that look like that of the cats We now know that these one of the civets entered our house and crapped all over our kitchen We initially thought it was a rat until we caught a juvenile palm civet in a trap I rode to a place full of trees without many people around and released the animal there The animal is now separate from its family and probably hiding somewhere Knowing my parents they would have had the animal killed merely out of fear Now I need to know if I did it right Did I ensure that the animal will have a new lease of life or only bought it some time

Question Background Check for Love and Arranged Marriages
So my family is looking for potential females for a marriage I have met with girls through the arranged marriage setup I am a M in a reputed IT company in Pune I happen to be a bit paranoid about a girl s history and past relationships Two of my batchmates have gone through the arranged marriage experience and their lives are pretty much fcked up now they were misinformed by the girls themselves when asked about their past relationships both the females said they had been forever single Now their SOs regularly meet with their exes both of my friends are highly protective about this They are having some trouble in their marriages due to respective exes and are insecure and have lost trust in their relationship Though I am openminded and am willing to accept girls even with bad past history but I need trust in the relationship and do nt want to be misinformed Since I do not want to go through such an experience I want to know how can I run a background check on my potential matches through the arrangedlove marriage arrangement A generic female match would be a F graduate working in an MNC from a tier or tier city Background check would involve criminal civil cases history of the girls close family members her past relationships behaviour in the long term and the nature of the girl s family

It ’ s getting tough to get married these days Better fall in love during those schoolcollege days and stick to that Don ’ t listen to love Jihad or Honor of the family etc Just fall in love If you strongly believe that you both will trust each other and live for one another at all times wait to make on your own and then getting married Mostly love fails on economic carrot attachment and on mistrust It ’ s good to know early in life that if your love is not really true Therefore fall in love irrespective of race religion and language
Dude if you want a girl with absolutely no prior relationship then it s a long road of suspicion jealousy and paranoia for you You will start being insecure even when she smiles at the kirana shop guy What are the detectives gon na check Talk to all her friends and scourge through social media to see her history Most relationship dont leave a physical trail It s okay if she had past relationships it s okay if she is still in touch with them as friends Built a relationship based on trust and take your time finalizing the alliance
Dude if you do this and get married your marriage will be doomed if the girl has self respect and finds out about you doing this behind her back

Why does India have so few coronavirusCovid cases and deaths

2020-04-21 21:25:37
From the article There are four possible explanations The epidemic may have struck later than in other countries Since epidemics have exponential growth at the start a small delay can have massive effects on the number of cases India ’ s day lockdown may have successfully suppressed the epidemic Physical distancing is one of the best ways to slow the epidemic and if anything many have criticized the lockdown for being too draconian in that regard India has not been able to test enough to count all cases and deaths Without sufficient testing many deaths may not be labeled with Covid for official statistics leading to an underestimation of the severity of the crisis India may have protective characteristics against Covid Researchers have proposed that the low share of elderly in the population the high temperatures and humidity in India widespread BCG vaccination for tuberculosis or resistance to malaria have helped India escape the brunt of the pandemic

Are you going to invest in the Indian Markets in the near future
Hey Guys As Covid pandemic is thrashing the world economies Indian stocks in the near future will be available at discounted prices and those who of us who had missed the boat during the recession can enter into the market this time What are your thoughts Apart from Sensex and Nifty I am looking at companies like Tata Elxsi who are pioneers in IOT and design thinking and Renewable energy companies because I feel when the market recovers in a few years these companies will rally up Are there any stocks in your watchlist
2020-04-21 20:19:47
tab bhi paise nahi the ab bhi nahi hai
I think we have a lot of wait and see what happens in case of an upcoming recession Tata Elxsi is a good company Good corporate governance and high ROCE are the main reasons why I am interested But they rely heavily on Automotive sector And a lot of their income used to come from JLR which will be hit badly Have you factored these in your valuation
Lots of stocks to watch out for Having said that I d wait on the sidelines until the dust settles We are likely to see a massive crash following the earnings season

EDUCATION A Proposal To Correct India s Broken Education System
Indian Parents its lockdown season now and we know that there s something terribly wrong with Indian education system I have a proposal I would like to put up for validation so some of us may be familiar with the term Socratic method for those who are not it is the way of teaching where you induce curiosity into the pupil s mind it works on the assumption that all knowledge is innate within us and just requires to be brought out I have been an avid practitioner and long time beneficiary of this technique It has not only helped me learn the oddest of concepts I am a law student I have to study a lot of odd bizarre topics but teach them with success as well Basically it s all about leading the child in right direction of thought it s about teaching the student how to think instead of what to think In my opinion this allows for greater actual learning and less rote learning I was thinking about it and thought about having some insight from Indian parents and students before going ahead and taking on the challenge to build a platform to facilitate this Would you want something like this How do you think this should be executed to best help your needs and requirements
2020-04-21 18:41:33
Indian parents will only wait till Sharmaji ka beta gets good salary and dowry before agreeing to any changes in education If education makes child question traditions No thanks If education makes child prone to marrying outside community No thanks if education makes child stand up to toxic behaviour from elders no thanks
Asking the right questions being objective and prioritizing properly is the right approach More people should start taking this approach all over the world Our current education system puts more emphasis on rote learning and blind compliance to social trends this is wrong It should ideally encourage learning by questioning objective analysis of the information prioritize ones needs and set goals a accordingly Acceptance should happen by understanding not forced by authority It s good to see people putting out some non political but very vital post here correct thinking will change this nation nothing else

Looking for advice Hi guys my grandma is an NZ citizen and she is stuck in India right now She is of Indian origin She is on a tourist visa which is only valid for days and is due to expire in the first week of May We tried contacting the NZ embassy and got told to contact the nearest FRRO in India I applied for a visa extension but they closed the file and stated that I have to apply for extension only two days before her visa is to expire Is this even safe What happens if they refuse to extend the visa etc I don ’ t understand this process If anyone is or has been in a similar situation please help We have tried calling the Indian Embassy and also the FRRO office and no one actually gives any answer

First off sorry you re going through this It s a tough situation I hope your grandma has somewhere safe to stay while she s in India Does New Zealand not do repatriation And do you have any evidence either a written statement or screenshot or recording of the message that you can only apply two days beforehand What I would personally do is see if there is an email for the embassy and put it in writing that you are getting this message that you have to wait two days and will be abiding by that as per the instructions given to you Most likely India wo nt allow international flights until June and will automatically extend the visa but just in case you face any trouble later it s better to have documentation that you tried to follow their policies
Chilax visa will be extended

Help Potential SIM swappinghacking
Hi I need some quick help I may be going through a SIM swaphack and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which was nt mine the last digits were different So I shrugged it off It did nt occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar Today I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number Only I had nt So I immediately called custom support had to go through so many hoops I am kinda angry about that and asked them about it and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM changeduplication request for my account and that I need nt worry On myAirtel app too I do nt see any ongoing requestsorders I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area But I am still on my nerves How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card And I do nt think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake and that too the very next day Is there something that I am missing Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now Any help is appreciated guys thanks PS I checked my own Aadhar card s authentication history anyway just to confirm and there are no records for any recent access

COVID cases curve is not flattening in india

2020-04-21 15:48:26
With almost majority staying indoors there s still spread I ca nt imagine what happens when they make the restrictions a little lax With the population it s bound to spread like wildfire especially in India I do nt know if the public will take the stay at home order beyond Mayrd either They need Stay at home till a treatment shows total benefit a vaccine becomes available and so on But it s not controllable in India It feels like a doomsday seekers statement but sadly this is the truth
Observing the trend I think the pandemic is here to stay in India those who get infected and recover will become immune and some unfortunate ones will not recover lockdown or not that ’ s it all this because of unprepared incompetent governance
Yeah we ca nt hold a lockdown post rd Our economy will absolutely crumble beyond what it has already The only THE ONLY silver lining is that despite inadequate testing repeated lockdown violations etc at the very least till now the death rate mortality rate in india combined with the number of SARI cases has been really really small I do nt know why no one knows why but some unknown factor might be working in our favor it might just be the lockdown tbh but who knows tropical heat yes I know it has nt been proved but it also has nt been disproved yet because studies are going to take time maybe it s because of BCG vaccinations maybe the younger population maybe inherently stronger immunity towards Coronaviruses the family of viruses not the one causing Covid etc Hopefully by early next year the situation at least starts to resemble normalcy Ps if this has nt slowed down in maharashtra by monsoon god help us cuz the situation is going to turn absolutely desperate

Coronavirus cases are not decreasing
From th april the number have been around only Extremely cool graph The numbers dont seem to be decreasing Nor they are increasing dramatically Both facts somewhat concern me they should be decreasing right we enforced lockdown to decrease spread And we are planning on opening lockdowns when the numbers have not even started their downward trend Also why the numbers are not increasing Is it because we are doing really less testing and the numbers that should be caught are not being caught If we have the capacity to do more testing we would end up catching more people with the virus Given our lockdown is not the most strictly enforced lockdown the spread will keep happening Argh sometimes the situation seems quite hopeless Thanks to everyone out there working to keep everyone safe Not all heroes wear a cape Thanks
2020-04-21 14:41:24
Doubling rate has sorta slowing now from days to days to about days now
we enforced lockdown to decrease spread The real reason behind the lockdown is to buy time the time to build the capacity to treat more people Now that some capacity has been built up the lockdown needs to be removed slowly

Opinion Palghar mob lynching should nt be communalised here is why
People who are giving a communal angle to the Palghar incident hear me out Mob lynching of Muslims get a communal angle because the reason of their lynching is often religious jihad beef or straight up Islamophobia The sadhus in Palghar got lynched allegedly because the people attacking them belived them to be child kidnappers thieves They did nt got lynched because they were Hindu atleast there is nt any proof of it So giving this incident a narrative of how Hindus are unsafe is just adding to the communal hate in the country
2020-04-21 13:38:19
There is also one more reason why it should not be communalized The mob that lynched the sadhus were Hindus too
We too have earlier communalized by outraging against the lynching of a Muslim because he was suspected to be a thief although he was not lynched due to religious reasons The biggest reason this lynching is nt a outraged upon is because I do nt see a single person defending it Unlike those with Muslim people getting lynched where there are people defending it but where will dungheads listen to reason
I saw a tweet comparing it with Graham Stains incident These people will go any length

Why are nt there movies made about important African Habshi figures in Indian history In general there seems to be so little discussion of Africans and their important historical role in India
So I recently did a TON of research and made a video on a man named Malik Ambar He s an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I was nt already doing a deepdive into Deccan history His narrative is incredible This man was sold into slavery by his own parents then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits I mean Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story There s the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan there s the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island and more Thoughts It struck me as particularly strange as many African communities in India are treated poorly today Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories there would be more respect Edit as people are asking me to post the link here for added visibility
2020-04-21 11:12:46
It s a regional empire most regional histories are underweighted ignored in India This is a major factor It s not particularly resonant with existing state governments and parties in power eg maharashtra is shivaji this and shivaji that No particular state takes up some of these stories now like the sultanate It is not super recent History in itself is not told well except as lip service rote elements fables vague allusions to great indian past history or injustice done by brits etc etc Few people really take to studying history It does nt bespeak any broad trends in history eg colonialism nation state etc Malik Amber on the face of it does nt scream african or escaped slavery background There are a lot of people with interesting stories in history whose stories could be told If you can tell his story in an interesting fashion you should try
Racism could be a reason seeing how they are treated in society today PS You should post that video you made

YearOld Walks Days Amid Lockdown Dies Just An Hour From Home

2020-04-21 10:44:00
Migrant workers are facing the absolute worst of this pandemic I hope everyone does their bit to help the migrants around them It could be food or monetary donation
Unlike people who think this is because of the pandemic this problem is actually due to ChildLabour why else would a child be so far away from home a problem so widespread in India and was very much prominent before the pandemic The only thing this pandemic has done is expose the already prevalent problems
That s so heartbreaking

We should start minting coins with different shapes or with holes
It is too difficult to figure out the value of a coin by just looking at the size There are one rupee coins in circulation the older one rupee coin is almost the same size as the newer rupee coin It is necessary to read the amount on the coin before paying If we make coins with different shapes or with different number of holes according to the denomination would be easier to figure out the value without reading Remember the old rupee coin used to be some polygon instead of a circle and the paise used to be different shapes If the coins have different shapes the shapes can be maintained even with the coins are being resized to ease perceiving the value
2020-04-21 10:34:14
My guess is India will print one and five rupee notes and slowly withdraw all denominations of coins in circulation Incoming inflation will make coins impractical and inefficient
Do nt give new ideas for demonetization season please
I think rupee coins will lose their value in the next years You will not be able to use them for any purpose just like the paise coin of today

PROBLEMS OF ONLINE CLASSES
Hello everyone every other school now has started teaching online and most of them do nt care if total strength is attending or not they just join and teach and leave They give a lot of homework and projects to complete which have time till July What if a student s pen ink is finished Now how can he go out and buy pens Is it even right to conduct online classes during this crisis time These schools only care about the fees They are teaching online only because they can at least take half monthly fees Some teachers do nt even care how the quality is Why are they even teaching when half of them do nt understand Some wont have a WiFi What about them DO they have to use mobile data for an online streaming like teaching
2020-04-21 09:58:58
These are the problems you all should communicate to the school no It s going to be tougher than live class I do nt know about the fees but if schools wo nt be open for a long time to come then I think online classes will be the way forward to keep the academic year going
Schools should indeed give some concession with fee as students are not using their infrastructure they are saving enormous expenses on maintenance electricity and so on And online teaching can not be compared with physical classes Schools should ask not more than of fees if schools remain close for next few months And mind it schools are only conducting online class as a reason to validate their fee demand they do nt care about quality most of schools are using zoom free account and take classes for min as it s the limit If whole economy is suffering schools can not expect to have fees on velvet pillow And do nt get me started about colleges
But this is nt just something Indians are going through Practically every school and university has moved to online classes around the world They re simply doing what they can to provide an education Instead of complaining maybe we should empathise with instructors and faculty considering they re going through the same conditions as students

Palghar lynching incident falsely communalised on social media

2020-04-21 08:34:20
I was nt aware of the news till late evening Twitter trend was to condemn the liberandus for not speaking up for the lynching of sadhus specifically targeting couple of celebs who are usually very vocal to portray their opinion I thought for a second their has been a murder and people are worried more about few people not speaking up for the victims I just went through the tweets of liberandus and found out that almost every person has commented on the issue and condemned the violence No one is bound to say anything but saying things responsibly is appreciated The irony is that the replies of the tweets contained even worse comments just vomiting curses Why so much hate Communal violence is a reality and no one is denying it But not every lynching is communal Just use few neurons if any of them are left
Am I the only one who does nt hear the words which are being used to communalise this heinous act If no then I do nt know how stupid can the people be that even without any credible theory they re going on and on pushing a false narrative
Palghar police who reiterated that there is no communal angle to the incident We were informed that both the accused and victim are from the same faith The accused belong to the tribal community India is going backwards to barbarian tribal period They are becoming animals and some upper caste wants them to be so that they can rule forever

When our stupidities anger friends in the Muslim world PM Modi steps in YouTube

2020-04-20 23:44:59
He actually thinks use by date of their hate campaign is over and that it ll stop lol how naive It does nt have any use by date in the first place because hate is not just an electoral tactic it is their lifelong character It s not even mere cheap thrills or stupidities NRC and pogroms are real government policies of modi and shah not just some virtual campaigns It ll not end With Bihar and Bengal elections coming up it ll actually increase towards the end of this year Why else do you think he tweeted it only in English and wrote in LinkedIn but did nt say anything to his cowbelt hindi monkey army in his monkey baat or TV addresses Another goofup he s making is mistaking opinions of those arab critics for opinions of their ruling monarchs Even if the critics are from royal families these are places where just one royal has absolute power and everybody else in the family is just along for the ride The ruling monarchs there just want to stay in power and make money from businesses which is why they are cozy with their fellow dictators like modi and xinping despite their assaults on their own muslim citizens

Relevance of Udemy courses in the job sector particularly IT
has anybody ever put any kind of udemy certification on their CV How much does a degree from Udemy affect the employer s perception of you I would like to enroll in some courses purely to increase my skills and get some certification so that I can fill up my portfolio and am wondering if it s worth the time and money or not xB Thank You
2020-04-20 23:11:48
Most certificates from UdemyCourseraEdX are not worth shit What you learnt how challenging it was and how you applied what you learnt is useful
Do nt do the courses just to show your certifications create and add projects to your CV add it to your LinkdIn too using your newly learned skills Projects do a better job showcasing your skills than a course certification because employers can actually see your code if you upload it on Github
Udemy certifications are self help kind good to learn but has no impact in your cv Go for coursera and do a course from a reputed institute

UPDATE LATEST and Final As of PM Just got off a phone call with him he had indeed gone for a checkup at the hospital since his neighbours suggested him to do so He has tested NEGATIVE and is currently at home I m expecting OP to drop any future updates on this post later today as and when he can Thanks for keeping up with this thread everyone As of AM He has reached his friend s place and simultaneously stepped into his house as well He confirmed this initially over the SMS with me and I had a very abruptly cut conversation with him on phone OP seemed to be in a rush and told me that he was at the hospital probably to get himself checked He will update me as and when he can but for the moment has support and that s really what matters NOTE For clarification he is not from Karnataka but has been brought up over there for most of his life His parents had to abruptly leave and go back to Rajashthan without giving him any prior notice returned to his native place ie Rajasthan The mentioned event took place just a few days before lockdown was imposed so he was left for stranded and that s where OP s text post takes over in contextstory All of this information is based on whatever I could catch from our conversation on phone so the EXACT details may not be accurate so forgive me OP and reader for any irregularities As of AM Small but positive update on his OP situation right now He s in Hubli Karnataka and is on his way to a different city km away from his location as of AM I was able to get in touch with him via my cell phone I do not live in Karnataka A good friend of the OP has offered to provide him shelter where his house is located He did have something to eat last night slept in the railway station He has attempted to contact the police to get some help but they simply suggested him to just get a lift from a lorry truckmilk service van to hitch a ride up to his destination If anyone is in the neighbouring area and can offer any means of transport to him right now please drop a PM and I ll share his number with you for the same
Assuming that the workplace owner is a helpful person Option Coworkers are nt the owners of the room Who are they to decide whether you stay or not Tell the owner to have some sane conversation Option Ask the owner or your friends for some money so you can stay with mama Do nt prefer Option since your mama will bring this money issue again and again
Do you have money with you Have you eaten any food Can you ask the owner if you can stay in the shop If you can find a hotel to stay at I will try to pay for it online and you can stay there for a few days ca nt afford much but will try to stretch the days for you

Pricing of Electronic Products in India
I wanted to know how does pricing and the associated components to it actually work in India This is in context to the recent launch of the iPhone SE and the OnePlus models The iPhone SE is launched at which translates to around Rs On the other hand the OnePlus pricing started at which translates to around Rs However by the time these products actually come to India the iPhone SE is actually somewhere around Rs On the other hand OnePlus is able to launch its phones in India at a lower price Rs in comparison to the starting Rs How is this possible Are the custom GST rules different for companies based out of different countries Or is there a different angle or dynamic to it
2020-04-20 21:44:16
Import duty on electronic products was recently increased therefore apple became even more expensive Apple is a niche brand and they always maintain their ridiculous profit margins because they have a very widespread and loyal customer base The reason oneplus seems cheaper is because they have overpriced their phones in markets outside India and are selling the same product in India with much lesser profit margins to increase their customer base OnePlus has seriously become overpriced nowadays for the kind of product it offers it s much better to buy a year old Samsung flagship in discount at that price
Oneplus products are priced a bit cheaper in India than US and also they are assembled in India itself so they save on taxes that Apple has to pay for imports Hence Apple has the price difference
India has taxation mate That can sometimes double the price duty for personal imports and about the same for usual products

Look at what we have become Denying someone his last rites regardless of him being a doctor If he was a neurosurgeon that is a big loss to our own society A neurosurgeon had treated one of my family members of a brain tumor This is just sad
The same thing happened to a senior Doctor in Shillong Meghalaya He was the first COVID death in the state He had done immense social works in and around the city and his village especially But after his death his body remained in morgue for hours as they were refused burial in home by neighbors and in Village s ancestral burial site by his own Villagers for whom he had done several social works And his own family could nt do nothing because they were held in quarantine Finally some church stepped in and cremated his body at a burial ground These COVID warriors are no less than Indian Army They deserve equal respect if not more I hope such demoralising events does nt provoke Healthcare workers to protest against executing their duties

Just three days back I had this dream It felt so real I was in a hospital clinic which was way advanced than what we see now I was accompanied with someone there There were two more people a doctor and his assistant in that clinic They were examining me The doctor then made me inhale something like a nasal vaccine Then he took a small syringe and he inject me with something in my neck As soon as he did that I fell unconscious there and I woke up here

Digressing from the topic Do Amazon and Flipkart maintain inventory for nonessential as well If yes how much Because at some point they would have to rely on traders and retail players when retail players are nt open then how would Amazon or Flipkart be able to provide with nonessential After all Amazon or Flipkart is an aggregator

I m trying to reduce screen time realized I was looking in to a screen all day Listened to podcasts for a couple of hours and felt better Have been meditating and it helps Extended lockdown can really alter your thought process and meditation helps to some extent but you ve got ta keep your mind occupied and take more than enough sleep
I do nt believe I m saying this but i ve started doing yoga It started with a min session to mins now Showing my parents English movies dubbed in hindi to pass their time as well Every morning i put up music in the house for some positive vibes Masturbating at least one time to keep the stress levels low I have this todo list of small things i wanted to do Trying to finish that Avoided staring at screens at least mins before i go to bed

No communal angle in Palghar lynching case Uddhav Thackeray

2020-04-20 18:38:13
There is just one question that I have in state of lockdown why would a mob come out in the middle of the night target a random vehicle as theft That narration of police totally beats any logic Does anyone have in memory any incident where a mob lynched a random group travelling in a private vehicle on suspicion of theft
Never thought I d live to see the day that a Thackeray would be sounding like one of the few secular voices in the country I do nt know what dystopia we are living in but you compare his statements recently to kejriwal and he would come off sounding like the moderate Power must be SOME drug to bring such drastic changes in their personalities
Some snakes on twitter prime example Shefali Vaidya are desperate to paint it as one though It is almost like they want us to have distrust riots and violence at this crucial time All the twitter instigators should be investigated

China is a snake dressed as a puppy Best blocked Look how the CCP is protesting now saying that India s protections violate the WTO rules Where were the WTO rules when lakhs of crores worth of state sponsorship was given to CCP companies to dump products everywhere at prices lower than the raw material costs simply to kill the domestic manufacturers You can not even get a Diwali lamp that s made in India these days and it is because local makers can not compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by China Honestly if a startup is really good money will flow in from everywhere Companies like Paytm are not real innovations They are data mining operations Great startups have marquee investors from US Singapore Korea etc We do nt need China They have taken over companies all across EU and Australia They sneak in then buy it completely
Paytm to Zomato Byju ’ s MakeMyTrip Swiggy Ola Big basket These companies are hardly innovative and just do the middleman business but online Too much VC money is not good for whole business ecosystem These companies are subsidizing to create monoduopoly and crushing down the other competing domestic startups We do nt want that Why did mere additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much HDFC is a systemically important bank In short a bank insurance company or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis They are colloquially referred to as too big to fail Owning every of HDFC is like owning a part of Indian economy So obviously Indian Govt will loose their shit if China invest more in this company
Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government Dude what the hell are you smoking Indian startups are mere copycats of Western businesses Flipkart copied Amazon Ola copied Uber Oyo copied Airbnb PayTM copied Paypal Zomato copied Yelp the list goes on Why did mere additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much Owning of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC HDFC Ltd is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector Even a stake lets them get into the board and they get veto powers A CCPowned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country No thanks What kind of thought was put into this decision It s clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required While I agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the PMO a veto against China wo nt kill startups What kills startups are their lack of revenue management Almost all startups are running in losses How long will financers back these companies Businesses exist to generate profit yet most modern startups do nt have those plans in sight both Indian and foreign startups as well What kind of relief will India provide to its startups Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further In this situation is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups Why should government systems provide financial aid to companies both startups as well as established businesses That whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion Unfortunately the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the financial crisis Yes businesses have been hurt by Covid and a lot of them have incurred losses as well Is nt it part of running a busines If startups do nt learn to not put all their eggs in one basket the government can not help it The most a government can do and I am not talking BJP Congress here is relax taxation and bureaucratic mess of paperwork to ease startups to get back to their feet

Erodov if you can access it and Techenclave could be good However mostly consumer products are sold there You could might as well put up a post on Olx or quickr and ignore the guys who are ready to buy it for

Why do Indian Men Love to Pose as Women Online
Ever since we were hit with the social media wave Indian men have taken it upon themselves to hide behind the screen under the guise of being a woman We all have heard tales of the infamous Angel Priya or an Aswathy Achu who have lured scores of desperate men with fake profile pictures and posts which are usually obtained from a hasty google search the latest being a Nisha Jindal who happens to be a year old male from Raipur Some use this as a tactic for extorting money from helpless and desperate victims But the others seemingly do it for the following or the pleasure of having many men following them because it s an outlet for their pent up aggression from being starved of sex or contact with women So what according to you makes them do what they do Any personal experiences you can reflect on
2020-04-20 14:23:52
Attention
When you say Indian men are you implying that it s only Indian men that do it Because I assure you that it s not the case There is a whole market where this happens Where ever desperation exists this is common It s an avenue of income for some

foreign firms mull production in India actively pursue plan as Exit China mantra grows

2020-04-20 14:00:06
For once can we step up and take advantage of this It s not or never because the next decade will have more automation and less cheap labor jobs In the end India will never again see a better opportunity than this to rise up quickly
Everytime there s a China related crisis someone pumps out this exact article Where exactly were they planning to invest how much do they want to invest are there actual agreements Is there a reason they have nt gone to South East Asia which has the industrial and export infrastructure along with experience in training and mobilising labour There s a reason why people have nt dumped China for its neighbours creating the infrastructure for this and the financing required is huge It ll take a decade or two and is no easy task The pivot to Asia was so significant it fundamentally changed middle America and it s rust belt This is not something a few companies will just decide on tomorrow

How come the police beat people up for going out to buy groceries but when it actually comes to doing their job they just stand doing nothing
This captures the horrifying incident in the most apt way Police letting it be the WhatsApp rumours and fake news during the time of corona leading to deaths of people
What the heck One of the three men was years old I cannnot even imagine what kind of a monster you d have to be to assault an aged person who just wanted to attend a funeral This is pretty much the last straw I have absolutely zero hopes for this country and anyone who tries to convince me otherwise is wasting their time either trying to justify a failed democratic project or by having an overoptimistic outlook

This happened a couple of days back as far as I know in India of course hence my posting it here Mom got a message on whatsapp from someone the day before saying the following
A truck arrived in a certain area i m not sure which where they informed the people there that they were going to distribute kg packets of rice per person Since most people thought that the amount was insufficient they did nt bother sticking around and left The others who were in a desperate state were happy with what they were getting so patiently remained standing in line After they reached home and opened the bags which had been given to them along with some additional essentials that they might ’ ve needed there was a stack of rupee notes in it as well Whoever had waited that day and was in a dire state ended up getting the money The identity of the men is as yet unknown according to the message mom got
2020-04-20 13:39:18
It sounds like a typical fake WhatsApp forward Most of them have some kind of morale in this case it s that people who thought kg free rice were stupid and people who were patient got in cash

For context State primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar said that notice will be served on the officer who expressed the view that it would be in the best interests of everyone to arrive at the results of SSLC students by giving them grading on the basis of the examinations which were conducted during this year Additional commissioner of Dharawad division Maj Siddalingaiah S Hiremath who conducted a meeting of education department officials had said that the meeting came to the conclusion that a recommendation should be sent to the secretary in the department of primary and secondary education seeking to arrive at the results of the SSLC students pertaining to the year by arriving at grading on the basis different examinations held during the year The minister proposes to serve notice to Hiremath for this comment The officer who had held a meeting with officials of the education department on the issue of holding SSLC examination had noted that Dharwad division has lac SSLC students spread over more than k examination centres He had said that it is impossible to maintain social distance between students during transportation and it is also hard to increase the number of examination centres Therefore the meeting chaired by him had come to the conclusion that it would be apt to arrive at the result of the children through the grading system The minster has taken serious note of the fact that copies of the said decision had been circulated through websites The minister is of the view that this issue is beyond the jurisdiction of the additional commissioner and that the officer is expected to implement the policies of the government He also is outraged at the fact that the additional commissioner held a meeting and got the decision passed even though he is not expected to do so Suresh Kumar said that the decision taken at the meeting convened by the additional commissioner need not be given much importance and that it has been decided to serve notice to the officer as he held the meeting in transgression of his jurisdiction For an education minister he does nt seem very educatedSuresh Kumar s arrogance is really showing here

Hello Randians Once corona patients are admitted to hospitals no communication is received till the patient dies or recovers If the patient dies he may not even get reason as covid in his death certificate since state government are trying to suppress deaths But whole of his family is forcefully taken into quarantine centre Their house is locked and left unguarded Many robberies are taking place due to this If relatives happen to become corona positive they will be admitted to hospitals and same process as above will repeat Government does not have a clear plan on what to do with corona dead bodies If they hand over it to relative they are unable to carry the patients to their home or near by funeral centres due to corona stigmas If there is no nearby funeral centre even hospital would not want to take risk of taking care of cremation Hospital also would not want to use those dead bodies for lab If the family recovers from corona they are not allowed back to the villagesociety even though they are showing certificate of recovery from the hospital They are forced to go in hiding Now even in lock down period cases doubling up every days India will soon have few lakhs cases The mismanagement will cost more life than the corona itself What is your suggestion to improve the situation

Ever since the lockdown started a month ago my father s health condition has been deteriorating constantly and today I think he has hit rock bottom He has Leukemia diagnosed in and Bronchitis and he s been so paranoid about the whole coronavirus precautions I think something has gone wrong with him I think he needs professional help xB He wears a mask almost all the time Inside the house Our house is on the th floor and opens from both sides IDK how but he thinks the air will bring in particles of coronavirus so we ve been living with closed doors and very poor ventilation for the past month We also own the roof rights but since he is afraid of the Air he does nt allow anyone to go there and for breathing fresh air he rarely stands at the balcony He does nt want anybody to use AC in the house because of pretty obv by now Nobody comes in or goes out of the house The last time we went for a grocery run was like a month ago We ve been fueled by just that times daal roti a day almost every day Fruits sometimes He thinks anyone can bring the virus inside the house Ration will probably run out in a week I have no idea what we re gon na do The last time I ate a green vegetable was also a month ago He Does nt allow us to buy vegetables either from the street hawkers or online marts Just when the lockdown started our water purifier broke down eff you Kent for the first few days we were drinking tap water by boiling it and then cooling it rapidly Then he got paranoid that it s affecting his kidney so we somehow managed to bring in a few crates of bisleri l bottle They ll run out soon Someone told him not to put the phone on the ear while talking so now we all talk on speakers or earphones He has had a total of or hours of sleep in the last days Takes a sleeping pill but it only affects him for hours its a mg Too scared to take any more than that Has nt had any fresh air for the past month Has constant headaches and migraines Long story short he is quite bad and literally on the border He cries a lot these days and it breaks my heart to see him like this So here s the thing He just wants to go back to the family house in UP Moradabad He s been having a guilt trip of not leaving the city in time and I do nt know how to get us family of there Is there a way I can leave border into UP without being stopped he also thinks that as soon as we try to go for the border they will lock us up in quarantine wards xB I m not looking for medical help Trust me I ve tried Counselors Psychiatrists NIHMANS Helpline All of it Nothing worked and I doubt anything will It s just the last hope To go back to Moradabad for some reason If this goes on He ll either Die by the end or either I ll commit suicide because you ca nt possibly begin to think how difficult it is here I just need a way to cross the border somehow without being denied or being put into quarantine xB xB Thank you for reading I hope you re safe

Why not contact your local police station and ask for passes to go back to UP citing terminal illness I am sure a resolution can be found
Wait till lock down ends rd May They will not allow you to travel before that for no reason Stuff you need to explain to your dad Air purifiers can filter out coronavirus and you can convert your AC into one using a filtrete Vegetables can be disinfected by boiling them and raw vegfruits should be safe for consumption if left for hours and then washed with running water before consumption Its actually good he wears a mask inside the house since with his medical history he s at risk Also coronavirus may spread through air check michael osterholm

Unpopular Opinion As someone who is not a BJP voter I begrudgingly admit that the centre government s response to Covid has been as good as any central government could ve given
And No this is not going to change the way I vote in and as yet The way Central Govt has brought dissident states like Bengal back in line and has taken the charge degree x coordination the new FDI rule it does feel that they are on top of things The amount people are willing to go through for someone they ve only ever seen on TV is almost unreal and the way many are genuinely following the lockdown in most cities is incredible Of course some of it has been overshadowed by overt minority bashing occasionally daft recommendations and foolish theatrics of thaali peeto But that has been a travesty since some good with a generous smattering of foolish I m not beset with an all consuming hatred for the government to the point that I m ready to see Indian lives lost and utter mayhem to see the government fall I feel that with the kind of support Modi enjoys had he taken a more moderateliberal more accommodating approach to the social complexities of the country he would ve been counted next to the greatest Indians ever ofcourse with caveats Such a stinging missed opportunity

I was reading old newspapers The st February BusinessStandard has Economic Survey GDP to grow in on first page and Coronavirus reaches nations on the last page That quite sums it all up as to what the government did Both Economic Survey and Budget do nt have one sentence mentioning the virus I then realised one thing people who ca nt foresee month in advance with all data available are expected to foresee the whole year with no data available
You re seeing the glass as half full nothing wrong with that However there is another perspective too
I think an important point that people are forgetting and failing to highlight is that we KNEW what covid could do to lives and the economy but the government chose to delay its response till after half of March was over Countries like New Zealand and Australia nipped the outbreak in the bud while the Central government chose to ignore the advice of medical professionals which came in as early as February th that the temperature checks at airports would do nothing to filter in asymptomatic carriers from abroad ICMR has also said since then that upto of confirmed cases have been asymptomatic

Lawyers of India what are the responsibilities of a business under the current force majeure conditions
Some questions that come to my mind are the businesses legally required to pay their staff for the lockdown period even if no business has been conducted If a labour intensive business has sub contracted work to labour agencies what are the responsibilities of the business For instance are they required to pay for labour s food expenses during this period Can these expenses be claimed from the govt for instance from the Disaster Management act funds

Watched it on TV there is no lockdown in Sweden they are just observing the social distancing and watching and taking care of elders who may be at risk The scientist says that the only way is for the corona virus to go is herd immunity It may be easy in Sweden being a small country with small population but for India the challenges are enormous yet even after lockdown the cases are going up

Hypocrisy of indian govt cutting salaries of employees while ordering private sectors to retain all employees on payroll
When the lockdown started Indian govt made a huge show of asking corporates to not layoff employees or cut salaries Even going as far as sending notices to companies asking them to rollback their salary cuts I will not even go into the discussion around legalityauthority to mandate any such thing But here we are weeks later central govt itself has rolled back the DA hikes of the employees Almost all govt dept agencies have announced donation of onedayoneweekonemonth salary for relief Do nt worry participation is Voluntary though Even hospitals took salary cuts from doctors to pay for a relief effort that largely involves doctors going above their usual duty and tackle this crisis with limited gear and resources In what world does that make sense Do as I say not as I do Hypocrisy be thy name
2020-04-25 18:22:03
Kerela government will be cutting salaries of government employees for next five months All states and central government are cutting corners wherever possible At least salaried people are getting most of their salary with a small cut Small and medium businesses selling nonessentials have basically zero income these days There is no guarantee that they may recover in upcoming days and I fear many will have to close their business or go bankrupt
Yes I was thinking along the same lines With the kind of business ecosystem this Government has provided for SMEs they have no right to bring such ridiculous rules Big corporates can afford to sustain this due to the reserves they possess Small companies can not adhere to such practices and why should they Having said that I think paying salary during the lockdown is fair because it was just a month and a half But expecting companies to not lay off someone if there s no business or revenue for an extended period is just idiotic
We are suppliers to automotive companies you can understand our business has turnovers but profitability is not much It is a labor intensive industry with high overheads As much as we want to we can ’ t sustain salary expenses with no revenues There is no cash flow Are we supposed to give salaries till we finally go bankrupt I don ’ t see banks giving out loans etc easily The labor union is up our ass We are so worried

Should Indian Government recognize the Armenian Genocide officially in opposition to Turkey who always seem to work against us
I cant remember a single thing Erdogan did good Hell in during the Indo Pak crisis i remember Turkey support Pak and later support the claims of Imran Khan on article removal Plus whats wrong in calling Genocide a Genocide
2020-04-25 18:02:32
ELI What s Armenia Genocide
I personally think that its just politics I mean would you wan na piss off a potential trading partner by just particularly trying show their shameful actions to the world which will end up with you gaining nothing but resentment from potential partner Powerful regional power in this case or would you try to play it your way and gain something useful for yourself I understand why US didnt acknowledge the genocide cuz NATO but the fact that India didnt recognize the genocide is kinda baffling Its bad that morality is considered an afterthought by the many governments but I hope that it will eventually change
If you are calling a genocide for being a genocide it s one thing If you are doing it for political gains you are nearly as evil as the people who committed the genocide

This article should nt be in the Islamophobia list Reason I have seen this Live TV A Relative of mine works at Bhadrachalam Temple Board They had only a mini celebration they did nt allow pilgrims Only working staff were allowed Its a ritual that had to be followed and it was done under tight scrutiny Do nt just randomly link stuff to Islamophobia Anyone can write articles that dose nt necessarily mean its the only truth Some have false narrative behind This happened especially after the Tabligi incident and media was also eager to post Hindu violations The Print and Quint had this false narrative so please do recheck with local or other news I understand your well intentions but his is nt a good one to make a point Thanks OP
When Kanika Kapoor did her nautanki people were absolutely ruthless in their abuse directed at her I remember in early March lots of vitriol being directed towards NRIs for being viruscarriers There was also a huge amount of abuse towards one lady who allegedly fled from Bengaluru to Agra after learning her husband has corona virus That news turned out to be fake But there is no mainstream word like NRIphobia or Kanikaphobia The public anger has a lot to do with Islamophobia But I also think the larger public anger has something to do with these facts you are silent about a Foreigners hiding in mosques across India after having attended Tablighi Jamat b Stone pelting and attacks on health workers arriving to quarantinetrace contacts of those who attended yes of these reports are fake but these happened I know of such incidents in my native place Bengaluru itself Happened in Indore Surat Madhubani Bihar Moradabad This Tablighi Jamat is already responsible for a large proportion of the cases in Indonesia Malaysia and Pakistan as well People are calling even references to Tablighi Jamat as promoting Islamophobia In the initial days were nt all corona ve cases identified by travel history to Italy or travel history to China etc So similarly I see nothing wrong in listing the source as Tablighi Jamat for many cases Better than single source If I m not mistaken a gurudwara function was also responsible as being a superspreader you can search and add that to your little list But this was localised to Punjab I m sure if the contacts of those who attended that meet also had returned to places all over the country and pelted stones spit on and misbehaved with health workers people would nt be saying very nice things about Sikhs either The people going overboard with the Tablighi Jamat stuff biojihad etc are those who anyway keep demonising Muslims Why should I a common citizen not be annoyed at members of this group for their actions some which were maybe inadvertent I do nt want to get into the controversy of whether the meets were held before or after Kejriwal s ban on gatherings and all that but after that has been a very poor behaviour I do nt buy all these excuses that oh they re poor illinformed WhatsApp rumours do nt trust the state blah blah There s no excuse for violence especially when it can jeopardize public health I think this list misses all that and pretends that the reason for the anger is Muslims gathering It s more than that

Copied this comment to highlight my point Only from the economic effects There are less old people and way less people with severe health conditions who in our rich western nations are only alive because of the health service anyway of India s population is under they are at no risk at all from CV The median age is compared to the USA Tuberculosis kills people every year in India and that is a disease that already has a vaccine So far the country is in lockdown for a massive total of CV deaths It is absolutely crazy that these countries are attempting a lockdown strategy when children die from starvation every day in India It s completely pointless the extra mortality from CV will only be a blip for India the mortality from the extra starvation deaths alone let alone the ensuing economic consequences will be way way worse Ilovewillsface I think they got enough time This virus is not as dangerous as they say it is and it also has nt caused much damage More people die from accidents other health issues I think India is strong and immune to face this virus without lockdown Why ca nt we just move on and live with it I think we re overreacting and unnecessarily damaging economy and it s affecting healthy non infected people as they re facing job loss hunger recession and depression suicides It looks like Government is not in the mood to remove lockdown till next year How much time does Government need before it can go on attack mode against covid

Could someone help me understand why some newer celebrities have such hardcore fan following on Twitter and other networks
I ve seen this happen with shows like Big Boss where every night they were twitter trends in support of certain contestants These trends were on top of the list surpassing important national events Today I stumbled upon a Twitter profile of a Big Boss contestant who released a music video a couple of days ago He seems to have a ton of followers who absolutely adore him and do whatever that is asked Like Share Subscribe view endorse defend and what not I watched the music video myself and honestly I do nt have anything good to say about it It remixed and ruined an old Bollywood classic song All that stood out in it where the looks of the two leads Not revealing name or link since it might be against policy I spent some time looking at these fan profiles and it looks like they their life s only mission is to promote him his music and whatever he does Who are these people and what motivates them to do this It does not look like it is PR campaign since some profiles appear genuine I see some posts where he asks them to show him some love and they appear do so no questions asked Its not just limited to this guy I m sure there are many I can understand if the acto is talented and the work is genuinely good and stands out in such cases there is value in sharing such posts but the work coming from these celebs is mediocre and honestly not worthy of any attention
2020-04-25 14:26:42
It does not look like it is PR campaign since some profiles appear genuine That s the point of PR campaigns make enough fake bots post stuff that actual people start imitating them You ever seen how cringy some redditors act in real life If you pretend to be stupid in a group eventually actual stupid people start entering the group and act like that in real life Its called third party persuasion and is the basis of all PR If I try to sell you a product you would noticeably be skeptical But if I hired people who stand by your earshot and praised my products among themselves You would be curious enough to know more Repeat this everyday with new people and you will get a fan following
Ask in they know a lot about this stuff
If it is the same guy whose name starts with S that guy is cringey as fuck His videos are all the craze in tiktok and my whatsapp statuses Girls dig him and some male friends of mine find his voice melodious too🙄🙄

Manmohan Singh Rahul Gandhi Slam Government On Zoom Call What They Said

2020-04-25 13:03:45
New Delhi Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh Rahul Gandhi and former union minister P Chidambaram were among a group of Congress leaders who went on a zoom conference call to criticise the government s move to freeze the hike in Dearness Allowance for thousands of government employees amid the coronavirus crisis I sincerely believe it is not necessary at this stage to impose hardships on government servants and also on the armed forces people said Manmohan Singh in the video posted by the Congress on Saturday We should be on the side of people whose Dearness Allowances are being cut said the yearold twotime Prime Minister Rahul Gandhi who had earlier called the move inhuman and insensitive raised what he called extravagance in projects like the Central Vista beautification in Delhi You are building a central vista at the same time So either you are not doing these extravagant expenditures But you are taking money from the middle class not giving it to the poor and you are spending it on your central vista said the Congress MP The Finance Ministry on Thursday paused the hike in Dearness Allowance DA for central government employees and Dearness Relief DR for pensioners till July next year No arrears will be paid either said the ministry The move will help save Rs crore in financial years and In view of the crisis arising out of COVID it has been decided that the additional instalment of dearness allowance payable to Central Government employees and dearness relief to Central Government pensioners due from January shall not be paid the Finance Ministry order said We can make the point that when you have not cut back expenditure on bullet train on the central vista development those are the programmes which should first be put on halt before you halt people s DA said P Chidambaram a former finance minister Some Rs crore has been sanctioned for the Central Vista redevelopment project to revamp the parliament complex among others Rs crore has been allotted for a bullet train project linking financial capital Mumbai with Gujarat s Ahmedabad by to mark the th year of Independence End

I know these kind of posts are dime a dozen on here but I still wanted to get some fresh perspective on a dilemma I ve been battling with for the past years or so So I graduated in doing my BSc in CS Phy and Math from a tier two city I got a job offer from a mass recruiter but I declined it due to not matching my personal ambitions and generally because I was nt too enthused about my job prospects with them I was first very much into doing my MS in a college with good options and in a field that I felt was challenging and interesting to me But before I could really do a deep dive and narrowed down the fields I got to know that it s a high risk taking a loan for myself when my family is reeling in them worth lakhs due to a new house construction I know I could have gotten a loan for myself kissing my family and the problems goodbye but somehow it did nt agree with me so in short I decided to not pursue my MS degree I took a parttime job working from home with shit pay but I still put up with it and focused on the few positives it being that I was able to start my own savings and pay for my own expenses I left the parttime job last month because my payments got fucked by the guy I was working under he used it on himself and decided to become selfemployed working in a similar field but with pay which is not fixed and depends on the availability of work and how many hours I put into it The WFH job which I m currently doing is in such a field that I m not particularly interested in nor have hopes of it sustaining future market fluctuations But due to a lack of options it seems like a somethingsbetterthannothing situation for me So this leads to present day writing this post and trying to figure out how the fuck am I supposed to move ahead For reference I m only and I know I have a life ahead of me but it seems like all my doors are closing one by one if I do nt take action for the future I want for myself one with financial security enough to puruse my own hobbies and interests freely Because I know in reality it s not that simple to get the best of both worlds Any further clarifications will be provided so please do ask me but thank you for reading this Any help or advice is truly appreciated Have a good day

‘ No Action Has Been Taken ’ Frustration In National Covid Task Force

2020-04-25 12:54:56
Please read the article first Our review of the records of that meeting reveal how having imposed an unplanned lockdown the government was not prepared even with testing protocols to track down those infected with the Coronavirus which causes Covid Confusion apparently prevailed and experts expressed their frustration at the lack of action despite prior advice The records also show while imposing the lockdown the government had ignored recommendations from its top scientists Instead of the current coercive lockdown these scientists had advised “ community and civilsociety led selfquarantine and selfmonitoring ” through their research in February The research had warned of a large outbreak of the Coronavirus in India and indicated that the measures taken by the government until then were not enough The scientists recommended ramping up testing and quarantining facilities putting in place nationwide monitoring mechanisms and arranging enough protective resources for healthcare workers Among the scientists who conducted this research were several later appointed to the government ’ s task force on Covid For more than a month the research and advice of these scientists went unheeded With no scientific strategy in place an unprepared government imposed—with a fourhour notice—a countrywide lockdown which sparked a livelihoods and food crisis among the poor and migrants The government took over a month to even partially consider the advice of its own scientists Gangakedhkar said at the meeting that testing protocols were not in place so far and he would discuss this issue with the ICMR director general and other researchers This was in March The government is so ignorant towards the top institutions like AIIMS They did not even consider the advice of the research until the start of April There ’ s a term called in Gujarati ’ thokam thok ’ The government is doing the exact same thing till date And then MoHFW comes and boasts about how successful the lockdown is There was no strategy till the end of March None

AskIndia If you were PM of India and came to know that a foreign country is preventing release of corona vaccine to cause maximum damage to India
Corona virus research is happening from past years someone must have already got a vaccine If you were the PM of India and came to know that a country is actively preventing release of corona vaccine how would you convincepersuade the foreign country to release corona vaccine
2020-04-25 11:05:30
A country should fund their own research
Corona Virus is like a big set of multiple viruses SARS is a corona virus based disease MERS is corona virus based disease So research on Corona Virus has been going on for a long time even longer than your years This new virus is SARSCOV and it got discovered just last year in NovDec Do your own research man xB If one country is actively preventing the release of vaccine I am the PM of India I have considerable goodwill and clout Also this would not only affect my country but also atleast a other countries as well Global pressure trade sanctions etc etc If they try to strong arm us now an year down the line the global community would be strongly against them
Boycotting their products using the people without any law seriously helps if we have more imports Eg Indians boycotting Chinese products Flooding the market with cheap products that mostly homegrown companies govern for exports Eg China giving cheap steel in India Controlling supply of important goods and or giving the same to rival nations These seriously hurt more than you think This has to be done without WTO problems

Armenian Genocide memorial at the churchyard of the Holy Nazareth Armenian Church in Kolkata

2020-04-25 10:30:30
There s a Sri Lankan genocide memorial in Kolkata too
Kolkata has a small Armenian community who moved to India after independence from USSR
I had absolutely no idea before today that there was a Armenian genocide After seeing this post I went into wikipedia and have been reading for the past hour If you are reading my comment I strongly recommend that you do the same I do not know how to express my disgust towards the demons that perpetrated this mind numbing horror The articles mention that little children were taken out into the Black Sea on boats and then thrown overboard I could not read for some time after that This reminded me of Steven Spielberg s film Schindler s List At I also found that A segment of speech given by Hitler to Wehrmacht commanders at his Obersalzberg records him asking rhetorically Who after all speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians Historian Margaret L Anderson surmises we have no reason to doubt the remark is genuine both attack and defense obscure an obvious reality that the Armenian Genocide has achieved iconic status as the apex of horrors imaginable in and that Hitler used it to persuade the German military that committing genocide excited a great deal of talk but no serious consequences for a nation that perpetrates genocide I now believe that all children should be taught about the histories of genocide at school during their late teens Maybe it will guard our societies from such things happening again I have also come to reflect that all genocides wars communal riots pogroms and ethnic cleansing happen due to perceived differences of race religion or other factors Such hatred will continue as long as these false differentiating and dividing factors are allowed to I do not mean to downplay economic factors or motivation behind such atrocities but the false differences make it easier to target parts of the population As I kept reading it continuously reminded me of my own country at present times Prosecutors acting on their own initiative have used Article of the Turkish Penal Code prohibiting insulting Turkishness to silence a number of prominent Turkish intellectuals who spoke of atrocities suffered by Armenians in the last days of the Ottoman Empire most of these cases have been dismissed During a February interview with Das Magazin novelist Orhan Pamuk made statements implicating Turkey in massacres against Armenians and persecution of the Kurds declaring Thirty thousand Kurds and a million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it Subjected to a hate campaign he left Turkey before returning in to defend his right to freedom of speech What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation it was a taboo But we have to be able to talk about the past Lawyers of two Turkish ultranationalist professional associations led by Kemal Kerinçsiz then brought criminal charges against Pamuk However on January the charges of insulting Turkishness were dropped for reasons not necessarily tied to the case a move welcomed by the EU This is just like our UAPA which allows our state to arrest and jail anybody without legal recourse At a symposium held on April Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned France for its official commemoration of the Armenian Genocide and termed the deportations of Armenians by the Ottoman government in the early th century appropriate at the time Just wow This guy just might be carrying a photo of Hitler in his wallet I will stop now with a last bit of information The American band System of a Down composed of four descendants of Armenian Genocide survivors has promoted awareness of the Armenian Genocide through its lyrics and in concerts On April the band performed a free concert in the Republic Square Yerevan to commemorate the th anniversary of the genocide Chop Suey just got sweeter Also Thanks to for this history lesson

I suspect it has more to do with a misplaced sense of morality in the minds of the unkills in the administration It s a surprise that they have even allowed meat and poultry to function more or less the same as normal groceries and essentials
My guess is possible increase in domestic violence

2020-04-25 06:25:10
A lot of bank and payment apps do this Not sure how this adds to security since the apps work even if you deny the request or easily spoof the location
Privacy goes brrrrrrr
Phone State and SMS permissions are already needed for many other applications Google pay will ask you to turn on the location to transact Bank security works on principles some thing you know pin password some thing you have cc CVV loosely OTP some thing you are biometric There are hybrid identities like mobile number etc etc Fraudsters can impersonate few but not all indicators So by adding more elements that are specific for an individual they are making is difficult for fraudsters to impersonate you People should know there is no security with out creating strong identity I m talking about design

How do you all take care of the garbage
I have trashcansdustbins with plastic bags I live in an apartment so we have a place to dispose of them and the rest gets taken care of But I have noticed that some people still only have trash cans and they throw the garbage in it directly and that creates a disgusting and smelly trash can Once we had new residents in our community and they used to throw the plastic bags out on the streets until someone taught them that there was a specific location designed for garbage disposal Yet still many people who have their own houses just throw the garbage on the streets I m glad though that I do nt have to go to those disgusting dumping sites to throw the garbage That s what we had to do when we lived on rent The plastic cans deteriorate very quickly no matter how much you take care of them and the steel ones of an appropriate size are quite expensive Technology has advanced so much but we still do nt have affordable solutions to these issues
2020-04-25 05:10:42
I remember when I was a kid I saw an aunty throwing off a garbage bag in street when we were playing cricket we all got so angry and specifically I that I picked up that bag and threw that bag to her roof top with full force idk then I realised what I did and ran away
Solution is recycling and an informed educated population

Having Existential Crisis and Feeling Lost and Depressed
Hey All I graduated in had been in a MNC since then till around November At that time i was quite happy to leave thinking i would prepare for MS in US and got busy with applications and stuffJan I lost my Nana It hit me really hard as this was the first time I lost someone who was so close to me and I was very devastated the whole month i still miss him though After overcoming it came february the decisions from unis had been coming and I was kind of enjoying and rejoicing every moment of freedom with my family as i had a strict plan for masters was nt looking out much for jobsinternships as well as learning and upskilling myselfNow comes March this pandemic causes my plan to go haywire and even the situation abroad is worseSo seeing all these stuff and many unis turning to online option which i really do nt wan na consider I started getting anxious and nervous as now there has been a lot of gap in my resumeAdditionally going abroad amidst such economic and health crisis seems kinda riskyNow I am feeling kind of lost depressed and overthinking has become an everyday thing although i have started applying on LinkedIn which made me realize how fking hard is it to bag a job outside especially software sector and since i am not earning since the past months it has made me desperate to earn some bucks even though he job is in a non IT sectorHope I get through thisAny advices and help would be appreciated Thanks and Stay safe everyone

Yo stop worrying firstly and take care of your mental health start going for jogging or something in the mornings and dont mess up your sleep cycle like I did during that time Have faith that if you know to code jobs will come eventually whether you decide to join a job or freelance Think of freelancing as an option too you can find smaller work and eventually get a lot of independance as a bonus too Focus on doing software projects or creating value now Indians think of jobs but dont think of creating value for someone through a service or app or something There are many options out there but as a start get your mental health together and check out online courses like Coursera Udacity and the like which have tons of courses to learn from Masters itself is a big gamble during a time like this unless you re a good student and have some money to spare Dont be scared of changing your plans when you are young and doing risky things
Consider doing research in your area till you get admits Consider doing a PhD abroad instead of MS as you ll be able to get past the uncertain times that lie ahead Do nt focus on earning just yet you should hone your skills and develop a unique profile

Two Police Security Guards and Official Driver of BJP MLA Who Travelled to Kota Amid Lockdown Suspended

2020-04-25 03:23:24
what about some action against the MLA that s not going to happen I suppose
So the driver was suspended for taking the car out of state without prior permission Fair response The security guards were suspended for going out of state without permission This again is a fair response After all if you break a rule you are liable to be punished But there are a few questions that come to mind which require clarification Both the driver and the guards are fairly low down the pecking order of authority even if they are government servants They gave been assigned to a politician who is the Chief Whip of Bihar BJP in their legislative assembly So not an ordinary MLA The MLA Anil Singh as a Chief Whip is a person who holds a lot of power even over his fellow BJP MLA s to tow the party line in the assembly Would a driver and two guards who have been assigned to this MLA have the guts to go against him if he orders them to help him out Would nt they have not faced repercussions from the MLA if they did nt help him out After all the man holds a disproportionate amount of power over them Realistically they were left with no choice in this situation It s either the fire or the frying pan Whatever they choose they will be getting burnt It sucks to be put in such a situation
MLA breaks rules prompt punishment for people following his orders hahaha fuck off

First ban ecommerce and then unban physical stores Is nt this very obvious corruption Even in physical stores why are they banning the malls which are mostly organized sector and not standalone ones who resort to more tax evasion and fake goodsmalpractices
Brain dead move tbh I understand closing malls but ecommerce should have been allowed over social distancing saloons what does that even mean how does it even work lol Opening small shops in localities is a death sentence It s going to lead to a shit ton of crowding and either the virus gets you or you get beaten up by the police This govt has taken some good decisions but quite a few brain dead idiot decisions as well

Indians who have lost weight how did you manage the dieting part
The problem is I live in a joint family and all of my family members eat food that high in oil and spices I have to cut down Kgs and as I have been told dieting is the central aspect of it I have never cooked before which I actually regret but I am really looking forward to learning I want to cook healthy diet food for myself Also is it possible to do meal prep like preparing and storing semicooked food for a week Just want some tips on how did you manage it
2020-04-25 00:33:04
The only thing that works for me is Intermittent Fasting and eating around calories I ’ m a girl and about ’ For me calorie in and calorie out is what works I only started working out after I lost the weight coz working out makes me hungry and eat more
Water man It s just crazy how amazing water is If you struggle with unusual cravings even when you ve just had your meal increase your hydration It is hypothesised that the thirst centre and hunger centre within the hypothalamus are adjacent So at times when you re actually thirsty you start feeling hungry Therefore at times adequate hydration may help you overcome the desire to consume something snackable when you do nt need to The reverse worked for me as I tried to lose weight I replaced small snacks with water And water based foods are really good too There s also some zero calorie foods and negative calorie foods but that s mostly just conjecture However sometimes when I m doing intermittent fasting I ll allow myself a cup of green tea which claims to be zero calories As far as modification is concerned first and foremost cut out all accessory food items Biscuits with tea Papad with lunch Do nt try stepping out of your comfort zone too fast You ll just panic that way Make small decisions that lead to small victories And yeah record these victories if you can they re a great source of motivation If you have a medical condition that requires weight loss like hypertension or diabetes do consult your physician if you decide to supplement your diet with exercise
So I ve lost kgs from the start of this year I did a couple of things First I Stopped eating all sorts of processed sugars No sugar in tea coffee no soft drinks and cut down alcohol consumption to of last year I drink chaach to fulfill my cravings for a cold drink The second thing was I stopped eating junk food No Regular pizza burger outside If I feel like eating something I order healthy alternatives to the regular stuff Third I started taking stairs instead of elevators for up to th floor That s all Did nothing special in terms of diet or anything just small changes in lifestyle

Is this racist
Hello guys I m an ispiring author from Brazil Love your country and culture So to the matter I would like your opinion Recently I finished my latest project It s an urban fantasythriller where a group of young people discover they have powers of gods and creatures from various ancient mythologies The major problem I found while writing this was naming the characters so for most of them I named them with something that could reference the god they had the powers of For exemple there s Fiona who has the powers of a shapeshifting witch Fiona being a common name for a white witch in Ireland Also Diana who has the powers of the goddess Artemis goddess of the moon For the one with the powers of Zeus I named Edison after Thomas Edison who had a great deal of influence in revolutionazing electricity But the one I struggled the most to name was the antagonist who has the powers of Apollo Until someday I mentioned it to a friend of mine and she told me to name him Ravi a common Indian name that means The Sun I loved the idea and I made him have Indian ancestry His ethnicity was nt a big part of his character just some background for him Nothing wrong with that right Or so I thought It was nt until I finished it that I became aware of the problem A major part of Ravi s early plot is his job It s how he meets some important people it s how he comes to despise the main character I had written this part before naming him and giving him the Indian ancestry He works at a telemarketing company See the big stereotype now This was never intended So now I come to think of it is this racistxenophobic Should I change his name and ancestry or maybe even try to rewritte the plot with him working a different job What do you guys think
2020-04-24 23:54:08
We do telemarketing in large quantities You could actually get a few people named Ravi with the same job Go on with it
As someone who also writes fiction I do nt think this is racist or xenophobic at all Do nt worry about it so long as it fits with your plot And good luck with the book
Would nt it be cooler to name the power of zeus as Tesla As the Tesla coil when demonstrated have electricity firing from its ends just like thunder Just an opinion btw which language will the book be in

2020-04-24 23:22:57
If you have a pressure cooker there is a very easy to make tasty and healthy chicken recipe My dad used to enjoy this alot with his single malt every evening For KG chicken you will need onions tomatoes and about cups of water Add tbsp oil or ghee to pressure cooker and heat Add cardmom cumin seeds cinnamon clove green chilli and fry a little Once spices are fragnant add sliced onion and a pinch of salt Let it fry till golden brown Add pureed tomatoes kashmiri red chilli powder turmeric and salt Fry till oilghee separates Add chicken mix it well Add water and close the pressure cooker Cook for whistles and let the steam escape before you open Mix in chicken masala and garam masala and simmer for minutes It is ready This goes very well with brown rice or as it is Sorry there is no coconut in there but it tastes soo good
Try these search terms they are different types of curry Kerala style chicken curry a coconut milk preparation Chicken Kondattam a spicy dry kind of curry my fav Pallipalayam chicken I have nt got the hang of cooking this one but it s supposed to be with dry whole spices Kerala style chicken stew mild white yellow color curry with coconut milk and green chilli not red chilli unlike earlier recipes Sides not very south Indian but you can try making naans or any type of Indian flatbread These can be made with whole wheat or all purpose flour South Indian flat breads are made of rice rice flour A typical South Indian one is called Appam Not sure you would have all the ingredients for that to hand
I d suggest lookup on YouTube Mainly it will help you understand many ingredientsspices to visualize and find it on local grocery stores

IIT professor develops software to detect Covid within seconds using Xray scan

2020-04-24 22:40:31
I do nt get this at all cases are asymptomatic They would have no Xray changes whatsoever CXR is the least reliable parameter for covid It takes time for Xray changes to develop so diagnosing that late is not useful Further is is this new We already have AI softwares to do Xray reporting for us since radiologists focus more on CT USG MRI and Xray is a very basic investigation that physicians and surgeons can read themselves most of the time I mean I get the need for positive news but what the heck was that all about
I dont think this works A patient with a mild infection cant be diagnosed by this Only severe cases And in my opinion if the case is severe enough for the xray to work the test would only be a fornality
Would this really work in early stages or for asymptomatic cases Ca nt see how it would

My experience attending a protest for the first time as a yo
This was written by me a day after the protest so the timeline will be referred to that way Yesterday for the first time ever I took part in a protest A protest which would open my eyes and show me our country like I had never seen before Despite having a general fear of being in a large crowd and being surrounded by people I for the first time ever felt safe being in the middle of a literal ocean of people I felt powerful not in the sense that I alone had the power to influence but in the sense that my presence contributed to OUR power to influence Walking into the protest I expected a lot of pushing and punching but to my surprise I was not touched a single time I had a better experience being in a crowd at a protest than I did being in a crowd at the Tirupati darshan Despite the sheer volume of people present over lakh the crowd was the most organized I had ever seen Then I realised that there was only one thing that separated this crowd from any other crowd lack of a selfish motive Every person present did not come for their own personal gain but for the gain of the country Be it a crowd at a darshan or a crowd at a bazaar everyone is there for their own personal benefit Even at the school assembly everyone seeks that one extra minute to complete their homework one extra minute to form their lines one extra minute to talk to their friends all for personal gain which makes the crowd at the assembly seem unorganized But at this protest the people represented the common voice on the streets not themselves No one expected to have gained anything at the end of the night Which is what makes a protest so special On the sight of me my sister and my mom a few protesters gave us a word of thanks for attending They were happy to see Hindus taking part too That made realise that despite this being a Muslim majority protest it was not about the Muslims It was not about fighting the government for being excluded It was not about religion at all It was rather about the absence of religion About treating everyone as if religion did nt exist It was not about fighting the government to be included in the list it was about removing the list altogether We were fighting for the upkeeing of the Constitution A Constitution the ruling party does not seem to respect Throughout our childhood in India we were taught to look at religion and treat religions with respect The problem did nt start when we were told to respect other religions but when we were told to look at religion in the first place Today when we read a name the first thing we see is a religion Lakshmi means Hindu Ali means Muslim John means Christian I myself am guilty of this too but today the protest showed me that despite religion being deeprooted in our culture we can learn to look past it A fact public lunching has more than doubled since that is since the BJP came to power The victims of most of these lynchings were innocent Muslims These murders have been left unresolved after the government refused to do anything about it Mob lynchers have even credited Modi as their reason for feeling empowered Any voice of dissent against the government would be silenced by these lynchers Today these voices can not be silenced They can not be killed It s far too late for that Finally the government has received it s most worthy opposition it s own people A government which does not respect it s criticism is no government at all The government is still trying to silence dissent in it s controlled states UP Karnataka and Delhi are facing the brunt of this signs of fear in the ruling party But every act to silence only raises more voices And the unity of these voices creates waves waves which make a difference That day I learnt the true meaning of unity in diversity I learnt what India stands for I learnt how powerful a protest really is I learnt the power of unity And no Unity is not a crore statue As we marched we saw and heard slogans and chants some abusing the government and some stating the objective but there was one chant which stuck with me and kept me thinking about the state of our country Hindu Muslim Sikh Isai bhai bhai bhai bhai Jai Hind 🇮🇳

the hongkong protest have proven that a protest does not require a leader just a belief in the right thing Everyone reading this comment you dont need someone to lead you anymore you go out and make yourself heard
You are so fortunate to have such an experience I also participated in a CAANRC protest held in our campus it was IISc Bangalore for reference Well my experience was nt as pleasant as yours The speeches made by a few people before the protest march started were really good They were about the purpose of the march being to break the dichotomy of the good Science students and the antinational Humanities students and to express solidarity A lot of good stuff which I do nt remember now The march started well All of us were shouting slogans in unison You know all those slogans against the government and the Sanghis etc Suddenly someone shouts Laal Salaam and most others follwed him or her I did nt speak anything but kept walking awakardly with the rest of the crowd I still shouted other slogans along with everyone However that was nt all After some moments some people starts shouting slogans against Communism It all felt an annoying distraction from the purpose of the march I also came to know later that there were some people in the march who did nt belong to the campus That was the first protest march that I participated in and it did nt leave a good impression on me sadly I may particpate again in any other protest in the future hoping to change my opinion Interestingly some days later I saw in the news that the IITB director had issued some rules regarding how antinational activities were prohibited as they would hurt the reputation of their institute which runs on the taxpayers money Around the same time our director also sent everyone an email telling us that freedom is important for developing scientific temper and conducting research So our director had decided to allow protests provided that the administartion was informed earlier and only members of the campus participated in the protests and that the protests were done peacefully This made me happy that despite all that happened in the protest earlier he did nt prohibit protests like in IITB It strengthened my opinion somewhat that IISC Bangalore is the JNU among Science Institutes Sorry for hijacking your post but I felt like I needed to tell this

I first came across this picture a couple of years ago via an article that talked in length on history of parallel cinema in India There s something so beautiful about this picture I just love how the tension between characters expresses itself thanks to the angle frame position and the actors It has come together incredibly well I happened to watch this film on MUBI app I think it s also there on YouTube It s poignant It s thought provoking And best part it s medium of art is real reality If you re into offbeat cinema please treat yourself

Mango season is coming enjoy after lockdown

2020-04-24 21:03:08
There are over varieties of mangoes in India Less than are grown commercially The World s of mangoes are produced in India million tonnes Second on the list China only produces million tonnes Despite being the highest producer in the world the share of Indian mangoes in global mango trade is less than that too in the canned form The share of fresh mangoes exports is negligible for India Anyway that means more fruit for us at home At home UP produces of all Indian mangoes AP produces and Karnataka produces so those states produce over of all mangoes Here is some quick profile of mango varieties so that you can know the mango you eat next time by its name Alphonso Called as Badami in Karnataka and Happus in Maharashtra Alphonsos are called the king of mangoes Totapuri The fruit size is medium to large its shape is oblong with necked base and colour is golden yellow It is widely used for processing Banganapalli Also known as Safeda it is a commercial variety of Andhra and Tamil Nadu Dasheri This variety derives its name from the village Dashehari near Lucknow Tastes rich and sweet Himsagar This variety is indigenous to Bengal This is one of the choicest varieties of Bengal and has gained extensive popularity Kesar This is an expensive variety of Gujarat with a red blush on the shoulders One of the most expensive ones Fruit size is medium shape oblong and keeping quality is good Langra This variety is indigenous to Varanasi area of Uttar Pradesh Legend says the mother tree still lives today in a village in UP The house belongs to a person who is mobility impaired hence the name Ambika This is a variety developed from a cross between Amrapali and Janardan Pasand and released in the year for commercial cultivation Mulgoa This is a commercial variety of south India It is quite popular among the lovers of mango owing to the high quality of its fruit Vanraj It is a highly prized variety of Vadodra district of Gujarat and fetches good returns The fruit is medium in size ovateoblong in shape and colour is deep chrome Suvernarekha This is a commercial variety of Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh Chausa This variety originated as a chance seedling in the orchard of a Talukdar of Sandila district Hardoi UP
as an NRI I can easily say that mangoes is the thing I miss about India
India should export more mangoes I live in Sweden and we only get Brazilian mangoes which are absolute shit compared to Indian ones

HalfIndian How do I reconnect with India
Hi fellow redditors I m a young man from Belgium my father is Belgian and my mother is Indian My mother was born in Puducherry in the s from unknown parents she was adopted at the age of by a Belgian couple Since she was adopted at an early age she does nt remember a lot things about India As a result my knowledge of India is very limited I m not sure how I should reconnect with my Indian heritage since I do nt really have family there I bought books about the history of India and Hinduism I plan to visit India in the future and I will probably start with the south of India I m considering learning Hindi or Tamil I m not sure which one would make the most sense for me to learn I have this crazy idea about going back to India even though it seems like a bad move financially speaking I feel like I could at least blend in with the locals something that is not really possible in Belgium What do you think about this Thanks for your replies
2020-04-24 20:45:09
I ll give some brutally honest and maybe unpopular advice Moving to India would be a terrible move Apart from genetics there s really no connection between you and India Do nt consider yourself a half Indian because your mother was adopted from India at the age of Even your mom probably knows nothing about Indian culture as she was adopted when she was so young so she probably could nt pass anything to you You have no connections no contacts not even any cultural reference Even if India and Belgium was reversed in this scenario and India was the better place to live I would nt advice moving for social reasons The truth is your far more connected to Belgium than you ll never be to India so you just have to accept that and learn how to connect and make friends with folks there and ignore your genetic makeup Having said that if you have a generic interest in India you re more than welcome to visit
If you plan to reconnect with South you especially Puducherry or Tamil Nadu you should prefer learning Tamil over Hindi because the latter is useless in this part of India
I too am biracial and understand the feeling of not belonging in either race You will not blend in in India You may assimilate but you will always stand out Accept and appreciate who you are and look for like minded people where you live Don ’ t look for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow as it a fruitless endeavour

A second wave of Corona is inevitable regardless of lockdown length
In my opinion a second wave of Corona will follow unless and until it has been completely eradicated from our country and all international arrivals are rigorously screened This is because regardless of the duration of lockdown India will not have herd immunity Herd immunity is the phenomenon by which a disease s spread is negated through immunization andor antibody immunity of a majority of the population Since there is no vaccine for COVID and antibody immunity is only restricted to those who have recovered from the infection a second wave will arise from the patients left untreated or undetected This second wave will spread just like the first one needing only a few numbers in the start to grow and only spare the ones with antibody immunity Hence regardless of lockdown a second wave is imminent after relaxation unless a ban on travel is still present Open to discussion
2020-04-24 20:34:58

Helping needy people in Coronavirus is great but like this
Saw on a news channel today a heartwrenching report about a man in Maharashtra with wife and kids he s a balloon seller and earned righteously before the lockdown and his wife worked as a domestic help But now he has been severely affected with hardly any cash and is forced to beg from people around like for foodgrains other essentials etc He surely deserves help and I m ready to But my family members say that since he belongs to our community Brahmin he must be helped and are pestering me to find his bank AC etc to donate a few thousand Rs In your opinion how do you view helping someone needy in such a situation but restricting it exclusively to only one s own community
2020-04-24 19:54:40
Sorry to say that s kinda messed up
So are you telling me your family is telling you that he must be helped just because he is a Brahmin your community and otherwise meh who cares

Why India ’ s petrol prices remain flat despite global crude oil crash

Sitharaman would be grinning rising fuel prices also have an impact on purchasing decisions wheeler vs wheeler Regardless it ’ s not the question of levying indirect taxes it ’ s how much and when the State chooses to do it that matters By hitting the taxpayer in the pocket during the worst economic downturn in a decade the State has exposed itself to criticism
On March it increased the excise duty on petrol and diesel by a maximum permissible Rs per litre each to shore up an additional Rs crore In the following week the government passed an amendment to India ’ s finance bill giving it powers to increase the excise duty by an additional Rs per litre in future Greed has no limits Wah Modiji Wah

One of the Apps that I have tried is Qureka Which is a quizzing app The quizzes are available in a lot of topics like literature GK etc One needs a Paytm account to which the funds get transferred Drawbacks you can only tranfer Rs once in days and need to have played around quizzes during that time Plus accruing of money is pretty slow The Referral wallet however let s you transfer more

Please read this lengthy but wellresearched report on ventilators Yes in the early days of COVID doctors used ventilators on patients who had trouble breathing However these days saving them for the worstaffected seems to make medical sense Essentially ventilators are very invasive — it ’ s a tube down your windpipe and requires general anaesthesia Using modified CPAP machines and oxygen masks and even techniques like “ proning ” seems to work much better for many patients

Covid Toes among kids New symptom of novel coronavirus infection

2020-04-24 16:56:40
Dermatologists in Europe and America are discussing a new potential symptom to identify a Covid patient particularly if the novel coronavirus has infected kids and young adults In March some dermatologists in Italy found an inflammation of toes and feet and discolouration of the organ of those suffering from Covid This condition is much like frostbite or pernio which is a condition found among people living in harsh winters in polar and subpolar regions Here blood vessels in the toes get aggravated inflammation and toes tend to have serious spasm The condition was nicknamed Covid Toes because dermatologists found it to be most prevalent in areas with a high concentration of Covid patients in Italy

The real loser in India s errupting Islamaphobia Caste politics
TLDR My unqualified opinion is that dalit political movement has seen the most erosion in the antimuslim appraoch the government has championed Note This post is for discussion If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you If you only have worn out down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind having merit and anti reservation nonsense I will be ignoring you Now that I ve gotten that out of the way lets talk The anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday I didnt think it could be possible but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack And such it has been since day ie the day the elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened I m forgetting where The very day of the results Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day So to begin AntiMuslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP HM and RSS since their inception create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse Now I m muslim And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP Dalits much like Muslims have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular Lalu s first term Maywati s first full term withstanding no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much So yes I do not blame these communities for voting outside their champions for fracturing the community vote But the fact remains that Modi s government has done spectacular work for the backward communities barring muslims We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal From being called Congress Cow it has been jokingly called Prakash Karat Cow Such is the success of Modi s socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth But coming to the matter at hand OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana ie upper caste repesentation is increasing Now Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease but this seat reservation is working against them I m going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this Not a single constituency in India has more than per cent Dalit population which means it ’ s always the nonDalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats To be reelected a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the nonDalits and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament Note that Balasaheb knew this would happen Which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats I am very much with him on this So who is the loser here Mayawati has lost her base There can be no doubt about it The BSPSP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not Why Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP Who else Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many Dalit leaders are few While Chandrashekar Raavan Azad has made a great big splash he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible Ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat all the while forgetting that of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims Here too the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste This is all by design mind you The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity And its working Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes Reading material Why Dalits voted for the BJP http wwwindiaseminarcomsnigdhadhruboguruhtm Despite having Dalit MPs why has the BJP ignored Dalit complaints Dr Ambedkar has the answer India ’ s Most Oppressed Get Their Revenge Narendra Modi ’ s “ twocaste society ” is a facade to hide the BJP ’ s casteist politics Half of BJP ’ s additional MPs from SCST constituencies Edit Also despite having a Dalit President the caste discrimination he faced while President has been swept under the rug Discrimination Against Dalits Reaches Its Peak President Kovind Wife Not Allowed To Enter Odisha Temple Edit again To clarify I m not saying that Modi is doing very good for Dalits To the contrary I find it quite counter intuitive that Dalits are voting for Modi despite the increase in caste violence Years of Modi Dalit Suffering has Increased Huge surge in crimes against Dalits since Modi became PM Mevani Edit More than one commenter has said that it is false that the government schemes have benefitted backward castes very much I do not have any proof for or against this claim I am not an expert and am only summarizing what I ve been reading from multiple news sources to date

I understand everything you say except But the fact remains that Modi s government has done spectacular work for the backward communities barring muslims We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal From being called Congress Cow it has been jokingly called Prakash Karat Cow Such is the success of Modi s socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth What exactly are these policies
Real problem is fake news Most people are nt smart enough to check facts by themselves
I do nt agree with the government uplifting backward classes and hence getting the votes part Most of the policies as already mentioned by others predate this government Furthermore most of them are either pure disaster DeMo mismanaged policies with potential GST or did very little compared to how hyped up they were swaccha bharat ujjawala MNREGA beti bachao beti padao and the likes existed even in UPA era and were better funded than now Poverty literally increased under modi so did unemployment and income inequality I should remind you that UPA under Manmohan uplifted record number of people after poverty in a decade a record only second to china farmers too which constitute most of the backward people in India did far better under Manmohan What s getting them vote is organised hatred they spread online Indian people are gullible and BJP were quick to capitalise on that People do nt question the policies because they do nt see the government as the problem the media and the IT cell have given people other enemies to blame in trying times Muslims Congress and Pakistan I should add if you think upper castes think any better of the backward ones now you re wrong Nobody s enlightened they just have a bigger enemy for now If hypothetically muslims were removed the caste system will reach it s former glory in no time

Facebook jio deal
Any Experts here can explain facebook jio deal What good this brings to our economy What are the pros and cons of this deal
2020-04-24 16:02:59
Biggest con is data gathering for Cambridge Analytica like services which is pseudo election rigging by targeted advertisements to the public in order to win elections
Not a far fetched prediction as it s quite apparent already Reliance will integrate Jio Mart from within WhatsApp And soon every local kirana shop will be told integrate with Jio Mart or risk losing orders so they will all come onto Jio Mart And shops will discard their POS machines as there is more merchant fees with Mastercard and Visa and customers will be forced to use Jio Money or Whatsapp UPI to pay merchants for which Reliance will charge merchants a lower amount of fees All shopping and transactions will happen in the WhatsApp Reliance ecosystem So many positives and negatives await all
In short Reliance as always is trying to monopolize and kill competition Such deals do the economy good in some sense but in the larger scheme they re detrimental to a competitive business environment If you want a longer economics answer it is here
