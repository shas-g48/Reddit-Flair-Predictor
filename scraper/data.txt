Question about credibility of Doubling Rate Statistic
The Centre Just declared that doubling rate of COVID has reduced to days As far as i can understand doubling rate means how fast it takes for the number of cases to increase to twice the number over a period of time Example if the cases are k and it increases to k in days thats the doubling rate So isn ’ t it kind of obvious that as the numbers increase the time taken to reach double will also increase How is this a valid statistic to assess the situation
2020-04-21 00:55:22
Because the disease does nt spread in a linear fashion but rather exponentially For ex First cases in days next cases in days next in days As you can see the doubling period is much much less
Worst case scenario is exponential growth Numbers are suggesting we are avoiding or moving away from worst case scenario
xB Let say initially One person is sick and after one day he infect one other person so total sick people are two now Now there are two person who carries the disease let say each has same potential as initial one to infect other and in same time In that way each person is going to infect person so the total number of patient grew from to after nd day in SAME TIME Now those each infects just but after day we have then after day to xB So the sequence is like a geometric progression which base is ie exponentially increase

2020-04-20 23:11:48
Most certificates from UdemyCourseraEdX are not worth shit What you learnt how challenging it was and how you applied what you learnt is useful
Do nt do the courses just to show your certifications create and add projects to your CV add it to your LinkdIn too using your newly learned skills Projects do a better job showcasing your skills than a course certification because employers can actually see your code if you upload it on Github
Udemy certifications are self help kind good to learn but has no impact in your cv Go for coursera and do a course from a reputed institute

2020-04-20 22:20:48
I am no expert but went through this myself last December Here s what I found Very important lifetime renewals no exclusions for diseases like cancer etc no restriction on number of claims per year outpatient coverage at least partially good network of hospitals claim settlement ratio etc Somewhat important online reviews on sites like mouthshut and reddit This is important at least to me because some companies like Religare have been known to provide fake information to IRDAI to improve their claim settlement ratio Also be very suspicious about the number if it is very high Good to havenot so important benefits like gymspa reimbursement annual free health checkup etc I started with Religare through policybazar but then spoke to someone who faced issues with the claim and also read the reviews online Then I went for ICICI because they were pretty transparent and shared all documents before I had to pay them They also have an annual free health checkupgym or spa reimbursement worth k and outdoor checkups till k

Assuming that the workplace owner is a helpful person Option Coworkers are nt the owners of the room Who are they to decide whether you stay or not Tell the owner to have some sane conversation Option Ask the owner or your friends for some money so you can stay with mama Do nt prefer Option since your mama will bring this money issue again and again
Do you have money with you Have you eaten any food Can you ask the owner if you can stay in the shop If you can find a hotel to stay at I will try to pay for it online and you can stay there for a few days ca nt afford much but will try to stretch the days for you

Pricing of Electronic Products in India
I wanted to know how does pricing and the associated components to it actually work in India This is in context to the recent launch of the iPhone SE and the OnePlus models The iPhone SE is launched at which translates to around Rs On the other hand the OnePlus pricing started at which translates to around Rs However by the time these products actually come to India the iPhone SE is actually somewhere around Rs On the other hand OnePlus is able to launch its phones in India at a lower price Rs in comparison to the starting Rs How is this possible Are the custom GST rules different for companies based out of different countries Or is there a different angle or dynamic to it
2020-04-20 21:44:16
Import duty on electronic products was recently increased therefore apple became even more expensive Apple is a niche brand and they always maintain their ridiculous profit margins because they have a very widespread and loyal customer base The reason oneplus seems cheaper is because they have overpriced their phones in markets outside India and are selling the same product in India with much lesser profit margins to increase their customer base OnePlus has seriously become overpriced nowadays for the kind of product it offers it s much better to buy a year old Samsung flagship in discount at that price
Oneplus products are priced a bit cheaper in India than US and also they are assembled in India itself so they save on taxes that Apple has to pay for imports Hence Apple has the price difference
India has taxation mate That can sometimes double the price duty for personal imports and about the same for usual products

Is it possible that Indian diet over the long term helps in building our immune system which is keeping the virus at bay for a longer duration when compared to the average European or American and their diets So the viral load growth could be slowed down increasing the incubation period making it difficult for detection in the first days even rather than days I m not expert so I m not sure how this works

Like the recent Palghar incident all the trending tags are HINDUsadhus even after the cops informed that everyone was of same religion Especially beejay pee is so butthurt over everything that they are always the first to come out and say shit like that with clear intention to raise tension among crowd Just why Have some humanity at least

People should have been simply tested for temperature and allowed to travel back to their native in bustrain and on reaching to the native they should have been quarantined
Seems unlikely km in days is too much for a any rookie to just hop on a cycle and do it If he cycled hours a day that would be an average speed of kph which anyone who has cycled would know is VERY hard There s either some misunderstanding or he just happens to be athletically super gifted

Amazon and flipkart do nt always have stuff at their warehouses most of the stuff have to be sourced from online sellers who usually have shopsshowrooms of their own Hence they may have to be opened as well Although I am disappointed that they went back on their initial orders to let them deliver nonessential products I do see their logic that might be too soon
I think a better option would ’ ve been to make the etailers onboard the local retailers for free and also make them deliver locally based on pin codes also not charge for any logistics since the local retailer can deliver locally This would also help in making sure there is no price gouging or consumers by retailers This would ’ ve been a solution that should be amenable to all

Wuhan were discharged within days of hospitalization Yes the record is for hospitalization but it also shows the persistence of the virus
But did the return from overseas within the last month or just happen to be people who work overseas
They might have Indian asymptomatic sources of infection Why do you assume they caught it overseas Once you assume a overseas source you can only explain it with a scary and perplexing incubation period Asymptomatic Indian source offers a simpler explanation and a more likely possibility But yes it also points to asymptomatic cases circulating in Kerala but this is true for most places in the world with cases by now We should do tracing as explained here to get a better idea

There is just one question that I have in state of lockdown why would a mob come out in the middle of the night target a random vehicle as theft That narration of police totally beats any logic Does anyone have in memory any incident where a mob lynched a random group travelling in a private vehicle on suspicion of theft
Never thought I d live to see the day that a Thackeray would be sounding like one of the few secular voices in the country I do nt know what dystopia we are living in but you compare his statements recently to kejriwal and he would come off sounding like the moderate Power must be SOME drug to bring such drastic changes in their personalities

They re smart They know either they have to be very good at something or really cringy or bad to be popular and guess what the choose
Leaving the rich people aside the poor who are making these videos have a genuine reason Think of their lives They are mostly doing menial jobs with low education and no possible hope to achieve anything in their lives They do nt work in IT firms where an upgraded skillset will get them a good package or there s any chance of emigration They are doing something today which they have to do for the rest of their lives The hypothetical elevation of poor people will not happen in India in the near future these people have no future to look forward to Not where they can imagine becoming wealthy or popular or anything that matters Facing that uncertain black hole they have found little interests that make them feel as if they are doing something that gets them attention which gives some substance to their rather mundane lives Most of them do not understand the cringe that the so called educated people are feeling after seeing their videos All they see are that there are people out there looking at these videos sharing them liking them Some of them are becoming popular in their peer groups Overall these videos give some reason for them to exist in this world a purpose or perhaps a feeling of being needed I do nt think these videos are cringey except the one s crossing the limits of civility but rather funny They put a lot of effort making them so instead of having fun at them please look at all the rich kids who are doing worse to get attention

YouTube channel for Class X Mathematics Advises will be appreciated
Greetings A friend of mine and I have started a new YT channel pi mates to teach class students Mathematics I would really appreciate any suggestions on the content And yes please share and subscribe this channel if you find it useful
2020-04-20 16:49:36
Try explaining them the tough concepts without tricks I personally find tricks a bit difficult themselves But if you understand the concept easily you will not need the tricks So try and explain tough concepts in a simple manner Also try and not mention that a certain topic might be difficult That lowered my confidence while learning online so I m assuming I m not alone
OP for which board CBSE ICSE or State board
I would recommend solving a tough question and assigning an optional tough question at a level higher than the standard after every concept Learning how to solve hard problems is the best way to improve ones understanding of basics

Kashmir Photojournalist charged under UAPA for ‘ antinational ’ social media posts

She s not the first to be attacked for her work
The police said that Masrat Zahra a freelance photojournalist who reports mostly about women and children in conflict uploaded photographs that could “ provoke the public to disturb law and order ” “ The user Zahra is also uploading posts that tantamount to glorify the antinational activities and dent the image of law enforcing agencies besides causing disaffection against the country ” the police said in a press release The police added that Zahra ’ s social media posts are inciting young people and promoting unrest “ The user is uploading antinational posts with criminal intention to induce the youth and to promote offences against public tranquility ” they said xB The Network of Women in Media India said that it was shocked at the charges against Zahra “ NWMI believes that the charges are preposterous in the extreme and amount to rank intimidation of a journalist who has won acclaim for her work which documents the travails of people of Kashmir ” the organisation said in a statement “ Photographs do not lie and her work as a photojournalist are clearly uncomfortable for the powers that be ”

Some Doctors deny treatment to minorities because they are minorities and these doctors should add these stupids to their list for denying COVID treatment as well

Brutal Palghar lynching during Corona lockdown sifydotcom cartoon

2020-04-20 13:42:37
How come the police beat people up for going out to buy groceries but when it actually comes to doing their job they just stand doing nothing
This captures the horrifying incident in the most apt way Police letting it be the WhatsApp rumours and fake news during the time of corona leading to deaths of people
What the heck One of the three men was years old I cannnot even imagine what kind of a monster you d have to be to assault an aged person who just wanted to attend a funeral This is pretty much the last straw I have absolutely zero hopes for this country and anyone who tries to convince me otherwise is wasting their time either trying to justify a failed democratic project or by having an overoptimistic outlook

This happened a couple of days back as far as I know in India of course hence my posting it here Mom got a message on whatsapp from someone the day before saying the following
A truck arrived in a certain area i m not sure which where they informed the people there that they were going to distribute kg packets of rice per person Since most people thought that the amount was insufficient they did nt bother sticking around and left The others who were in a desperate state were happy with what they were getting so patiently remained standing in line After they reached home and opened the bags which had been given to them along with some additional essentials that they might ’ ve needed there was a stack of rupee notes in it as well Whoever had waited that day and was in a dire state ended up getting the money The identity of the men is as yet unknown according to the message mom got
2020-04-20 13:39:18
It sounds like a typical fake WhatsApp forward Most of them have some kind of morale in this case it s that people who thought kg free rice were stupid and people who were patient got in cash
Similar to Trump paying off mortgage of a poor man

For context State primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar said that notice will be served on the officer who expressed the view that it would be in the best interests of everyone to arrive at the results of SSLC students by giving them grading on the basis of the examinations which were conducted during this year Additional commissioner of Dharawad division Maj Siddalingaiah S Hiremath who conducted a meeting of education department officials had said that the meeting came to the conclusion that a recommendation should be sent to the secretary in the department of primary and secondary education seeking to arrive at the results of the SSLC students pertaining to the year by arriving at grading on the basis different examinations held during the year The minister proposes to serve notice to Hiremath for this comment The officer who had held a meeting with officials of the education department on the issue of holding SSLC examination had noted that Dharwad division has lac SSLC students spread over more than k examination centres He had said that it is impossible to maintain social distance between students during transportation and it is also hard to increase the number of examination centres Therefore the meeting chaired by him had come to the conclusion that it would be apt to arrive at the result of the children through the grading system The minster has taken serious note of the fact that copies of the said decision had been circulated through websites The minister is of the view that this issue is beyond the jurisdiction of the additional commissioner and that the officer is expected to implement the policies of the government He also is outraged at the fact that the additional commissioner held a meeting and got the decision passed even though he is not expected to do so Suresh Kumar said that the decision taken at the meeting convened by the additional commissioner need not be given much importance and that it has been decided to serve notice to the officer as he held the meeting in transgression of his jurisdiction For an education minister he does nt seem very educatedSuresh Kumar s arrogance is really showing here

First of all I have utmost respect for the people who put forth the safety of others before their own and are sincerely standing their grounds to do whatever little or more they can do to be of help for anybody not only in the current situation but anytime Now to proceed I am going to rant about the recent experiences I ve had with cops medical professionals and some common folk Starting with cops My dad is a cancer patient and has to chemos every month When he is hospitalised one of the family members has to do rounds at the hospital daily obviously After the lockdown at the fuel stations they stopped giving out fuel to anyone who was nt a shopkeeper or a pharmacist or the likes i am not against the initiative but there need to be exceptions which is why we ran short of fuel in almost all our vehicles that we registered on punepolicein Which is why day I had to borrow my cousins bike to visit the hospital and a cop stopped me and asked for the bar code provided for registration I showed the bar code and also made it clear that it s not my bike and also showed proofs that my visit was genuine and an emergency to which the cop hit me with his batton used language like would it be okay if I took your wife just because mine was nt home Like this is the example he thought of coming up and for a fact I was nt strolling but it was important and I did not have a choice but to take somebody else s bike These people just need a little power and they fucking cross all limits possible Now about the medical institutions specially POONA HOSPITAL by MANIKCHAND DHARIWAL Last month when my dad was admitted the ward he was in was filled with bed bugs Like literally the entire ward was filled with bed bugs to such an extent that all patients had to be moved right away and the ward was kept shut for one whole month This month after the COVID situation got worse and lockdown was announced they stopped providing hand sanitizers throughout the hospital despite of the situation going around and this is not a shop or just any place but a fucking hospital that charges you app k for a day only for stay After the above experience this week my dad had to be hospitalised again because of the side effects from chemo got worse Now on the second and third day they did nt change his bedsheets He was left in the same dirty sheets for days and he is cancer patient we know how bad their immunity gets once the chemo begins They did nt provide clean laundry stating that they have run out of sheets while they have entire wards empty His bed sheets had blood stains and what not for three days as the IV they use needs to be changed daily to avoid infection And for this when we tried to voice out the authorities and the doctors themselves started exchanging harsh words with us as if it s us who is making the mistake And to top this off they charge the entire bill not a penny less We are spending like fucking k for a day minimum we are trusting these shitheads with the life of our nakama and they have the audacity to treat us like shit After the above experiences I am in a dilemma like what is it to be someone in power what fun does one get by behaving like that just because they have the upper hand Like seriously is being a plain human that difficult These officials may it be a medical or political do they really have power over us Truth be told they are whatever they are because we make them TLDR The world around us either gets better or stoops straight to hell Btw I know doctors who are practicing in Australia and stay in constant contact with us to ensure my dad s healthy yet I am shocked the ones we came across who are getting paid from this are acting this way

Meanwhile cops turn a blind eye to everything else like the recent wedding which took place courtesy of KumaraswamyI guess it really is true that the rich can bend the rules while the rules can be used to bend over a common man like me
Really sorry for your dad ’ s shitty experience Power really does go to anyone ’ s head Especially the people with minimal amounts of power Completely unrelated but you calling your family nakama threw me off Wasn ’ t expecting that there
Tldr Duh yes Full version yes definitely Imagine if you had been in a Mercedes or BMW No cop would even dare to touch you or your car even Money and power definitely work everywhere and laws are mostly to protect the wealth of rich and the power of those already in power Common people are expected to follow the law Those who question the status quo are branded as radicals and those who follow are rewarded with positions of power Long story short you my friend as a middle class Indian do nt have any say or any place where your voice will be heard Maybe except randia Peace out

To all my Muslim friends what are your plans on how to spend the initial days of Ramadan during lockdown
Lockdown till May rd might get extended Ramadan starts this Thursday How are you guys planning to spend the Ramadan during the lockdown I mean the sehari iftari will be in home without the social gathering and what about the bazaar to buy the watermelons and veggies etc This year will be different staying in a Muslim community I ’ m gon na miss the Iftaar and the invitations bummer
2020-04-20 10:52:03
My plan is simple Stay awake till Sehri sleep till the afternoon prayer Get up do whatever i can staying indoors till evening Go out to get groceries and veggiesfruits My appartment building has few vendors available at all time Do iftar stay awake repeat till rd may Then maybe I ll be called to join back my hospital
In a lockdown sehri and iftari at home even if some shops are open its risky to go out unnecessary mosques are closed and any gathering is a no go area lets see what happened after maybe some respite in lockdown
It s called Ramzan Do nt spread your wahabbi propaganda here

2020-04-20 10:40:46
If the bakery is making bread there is a chance its classified as essential Call your local councillor or PS for clarification
Just look at the twitter handle of your state police they have released the services list I am from Jharkhand and Jharkhand police has released the data
Bakeries are allowed to be open and have been classified as essential afaik I d suggest you father takes a mask and adequate hand sanitizer and ask him to use gloves and a tray to handle money Just another thought that he has to think long term and in the next months job security is going to be vital

COVID numbers in Mumbai likely to fall by next week New protocol says asymptomatic contacts to be tested only after five days So fewer tests means fewer detections but the curve will not flatten

2020-04-20 10:25:35
New protocol says asymptomatic contacts to be tested only after five days So fewer tests means fewer detections but the curve will not flatten Test has its limitations Asymptomatic means low viral load Testing low viral load means more false negatives More false negatives means more people will let out under an impression that they are not infected They will end up infecting more people ICMR already put a statement out in March regarding the same The suggestion is counterproductive They need to quarantine the suspects and test them after days It s inaccurate before that as viral load will be low
This is wrong on so many levels Most of the young and healthy infected people will not showcase ANY visible symptoms of this virus during first days of the incubation period and will still be able to pass it on Perfectly healthy looking people have turned out to be super spreaders in other countries and now our citiesstates are going to make the exact same mistake again

Price of testing kits should be based on income
Nearly female and male workers in India earn earn less than per month since most of them can ’ t afford to pay for test kits all government testing labs should be reserved for people of households with income below k pm they should be tested for free People from households with income more than per month have to pay some amounts with some subsidies depending on income for testing and should be tested at private labs only People in the bracket pm to pm aren ’ t exactly welloff either they should pay ₹ per test People in the bracket can pay in s therefore they should pay ₹ per test People in the bracket are pretty well off and should pay ₹ per test People earning above ₹ lakh per month should pay ₹ per test And people earning above ₹ lakh per month should pay ₹ per test The point of well earning people paying more is that they ’ d be able to fund Indian based manufacturers to boost their production of rapidtesting kits and also the number of private labs Government bidding test kits from foreign countries should have separate budget as usual As of now almost all Indian based companies are planning to keep the cost below ₹ Assuming we ’ ve got test kits from China days ago with some stocks and two of our local companies HLL and Voxtur that have begun production and expect to produce by the end of the week With more fundings they should be able to meet or even surpass the foreign bought rapid test kits in production units Hypothetically if everything goes well we might be able to cross million tests mark by the end of April
2020-04-20 09:13:14
For the Nth time COVID testing is already free in govt labs and most of the labs equipped to test it are govt labs Only private labs are allowed to charge and that too is covered under Ayushman Bharat scheme which takes care of low income families Let private labs charge whatever they want if the free option is already available The kind of multitiered pricing you are suggesting is overregulation and nonsensical bureaucracy Do I need to take my income certificate to get the test done Edit List of govt labs collection sites List of private labs Edit Also ICMR is starting rapid antibody testing which is cheaper and quicker for mass testing
Testing is free in all government facilities and to be made free for poor in private labs following supreme court directive state will pay
Assuming cost of tests to be so for people cost will be Population that needs to have free tests Averaging men and women of the population has to pay an average of Rs per test Assuming another of the population makes between and pay Rs Now we have to be subsidised by of the population This is assuming Rs for Rs double the pricing subsidies required

PUBG is mobile friendly You could literally play a game on the college staircase after being kicked out of the lecture lol Besides majority people have basic laptops or computers that are nt good enough to run CSGO it not too graphic intensive but my XPS could nt run it on default settings without lagging and frame drops The high number of PUBG players you see in India are mostly mobile users I think
Why do people eat pulao when biryani is more delicious
I have not played Counter Strike that much but I have invested many hours in PUBG I think CS may be more fun but not many Indians have actually got a chance to play it PUBGM is more popular among the Indian youth because of the following reasons It is freeee A higher reach A bigger percentage of the Indian youth owns a smartphone rather than a PC PUBGM came out at the same time when most of India started getting mobile data at cheap rates The YouTube hype I guess these might be it Others can also add points I missed out

why are so many indians and sri lankans so arrogant
I know they re not the same but i will just say india instead of saying India and sri lanka every single time because india is more relevant to my subjective experience and because of simplicity so im not meaning to offend anybody but i ve met people from both bakcgrounds and i like and respect their culture but i ve noticed something that i usually ignore unitl it s just too annoying xB So yeah maybe I do nt know so many indians and of course i ca nt speak for all of them but literally every single one of the ones i ve been exposed to except for mutahar from some ordinary gamers youtube channel are very arrogant andor egotistical For example i ve met and talked to or been exposed to people from india or with an indian background on the internet living in canada in my country and abroad in other countries in europe and also in china and japan Oh and of course indian scammers through the phone and in videos lol Some of the things I ve noticed a lot is that they will say India is the greatest country ever better and more powerful than the US russia and china combined they will bloat and lie in a lie cheat or steal kind of attitude in order to not admit that maybe they are not the best country or that they personally are not the greatest in math or tech in the world xB Like for example i m from a third world country and it s okay got no problem with that When I went to school a classmate who is from india while in canada kept saying how india is the greatest nation to ever exist and me and a friend just told him that was stupid nationalism and even if it mattered it s obvious india ca nt be the best at everything because no country can but man was he stubborn about the matter xB I ve noticed many people like for example phone scammers act this way to justify shitty actions especially against americans which i mean yeah everybody hates americans i get it but why make stuff up to justify yourself or why pretend or lie about being better than others xB Also i ve noticed many times that many indians cheat or lie and when caught they will never ever accept it this happened with some people who stole money from my parents and even on private face to face conversations they acted as if it never happened when everybody involved knows it did there was no point on lying Months later that same person asked for money and said he would call the cops because of the illegal practices we did if he didnt have the money And of course there were no illegal practices he could ve just said he was going to sue us on fake allegations but he chose to flat out lie in a way that even a year old could tell it was a lie That lie was so stupid that of course the cops never showed up and he never sued us xB Now do nt get me wrong ive met some really cool indian people and some of the people that i ve seen having this attitude are actually very good people or at least most of the time but I just do nt get it everytime i have called on or seen an indian person being called on some arrogant or selfish behaviour they traight up LIE with the worst lies ever they would make up literally ANYTHING before accepting they may be wrong and not be the best person in the whole planet xB I just find it interesting that this kind of personalities have been present every single time i have been exposed to indian people Especially since ive seen a lot of indian people who will cheat or backstab others without remorse and then just lie about it compared to people from other cultures ive met ive travelled and lived aborad a lot so indian people are just one of the several cultures ive been exposed to a lot and this came to my mind after a long time when reading people expressing the same feelings online xB it s like if you get caught pointing a gun to someones head and say yeah it was nt me it was someone else like dude i saw it was you did you really think that would change my mind xB I mean is there a cultural reason behind it xB Is india a very nationalist country that brainwashes people xB do indian people live in denial xB or maybe it s just a huge coincidence then why am i not the only one who thinks that xB the best example i can think of is the designated pooping street meme where some guy tries so hard to make india look like a first world country when it clearly isnt and everybody knows it Why pretend being someone you re not as a fellow third world country dweller i just accept my country is great in some aspects and needs huge improvement in others it s okay xB I just do nt get it xB what is your own opinon on it maybe some of you actually have seen this on your fellow countrymen and actually dont like it or am projecting a wrongful perception of people from india I d like to know what you guys think xB edit after rereading my post i think i left there a chance to sound like i m saying all people i know from india are bad people just in case it was only a handful of truly bad experiences but the proudarogant attitude is what i m asking about i m not saying all indians are cheaters or back stabbers i m saying that the ones that actually are like in any culture there will be some will have this attitude and it s interesting how far they will go to keep a lie or avoid criticism even if it s clear they are wrong Also the good indian people i know may show this arrogant side of them just when talking about countries or politics not always of course i m not saying it is always a very defining trait of their personality but a trait that is very common to surface at least once in my own experience I hope i did nt offend anyone because i am genuinely interested in this i like indian food folklore art and philosophy i am personally inclined to buddhism

Big ego large insecurities In India they can get away with it with a variety of stuff independent of inherent value like gender caste religion salary etc etc Go abroad where none of these things are given the same importance see their egos wriggle and thrash Thats what youre seeing
Inferiority complex coupled with crisis in masculinity Caste system anyway meant one can be greater than others without achieving anything Forget about social injustice for a moment and think about the psychological impact of the fear of being found out

How are Indians expats or not communicating with local Armenians in Armenia

2020-04-20 01:51:57
A lot of us only come abroad for money Everything else like assimilation is not a priority
Usually people tend to stay in their groups as they resemble culture and it often easier to talk form bonds You should go ahead and talk first

So what happens after the lockdown
I fear people are lax in thinking life will go back to normal after the lockdown The government did nt take any measure to implement widespread testing hence we really do nt have enough data to identify the clusters or hotspots It s like a ticking time bomb once the lockdown is over in a matter of weeks we could expect the infection cases to climb up again exponentially Not to mention they just left the poorest of the poor to die helplessly on the roads Are we just going to ignore the piles of bodies I do nt see anyone talking about any plans for the future This is nt going to go away until a solid vaccine is discovered What are we going to do going forward
2020-04-20 01:22:10
I would recommend still to avoid going out unnecessary Monitor how the cases curve is going then take a decision Especially no vacations keep hand sanitizer with you and wear mask as usual
Lockdowns rinse and repeat Master strokes rinse and repeat Thali banging and impromptu Diwali rinse and repeat Mahabharata and Ramayana rinse and repeat
If you think May rd will be the end of the lockdown you ’ re deeply mistaken People will panic horribly if they announce lockdown for months at once I expect the govt to extend the lockdown once again for two more weeks and then for two additional weeks a total of additional month after May This won ’ t end anytime soon

HCQ to be tested on thousands in Mumbai ’ s Dharavi and Worli to prevent Covid spread
BMC is going to start testing effectiveness of HCQ among residents of Worli and Dharavi Article From what I know the drug has sideeffects and it s efficacy has been contested in several clinical trials The article mentions that the initial plan of testing people has been scaled down and a target group will be identified after recording their medical history and consent for the study As a layman I had the following questions What are the possible sideeffects the drug has on an average person with no underlying health conditions Given that even the young residents in slums are more likely to have underlying health conditions due to poor living conditions quality of water sanitation etc is it more likely that these side effects would affect them adversely What implications does it have for the results of the experiment even if it s carried out as planned Link to study for this claim here Are there any examples of similar clinical trials conducted on a population at this scale elsewhere in the past From what I know such trials are usually conducted in clinics at a much smaller scale Thoughts about notion of informed consent for this study under these conditions EDIT Added the fourth question fixed a typo
2020-04-20 01:03:31
Is nt this drug causing arrhythmia I read that few trials stopped because of the no of people it caused heart related side effects were a lot more than expected I guess in cases where there is no hope and they are in intensive care it can be used as a last resort but hopefully not in the younger patients who are otherwise healthy

Bengal sitting on a coronavirus time bomb

cure is prevention than betterness didi
Didiji more focused on not offending her vote bank then on safety of people of her state The whole state machinery is more focused on controlling the narrative than on controlling the diseaseHiding the actual number of cases and deaths will only hinder the fight against the virus They are deliberately making sure that less and less people are being tested so that the numbers on paper remain low She does not care about doctors we already know that from previous violence incident against doctors and her reaction to it
One excerpt Many in Kolkata say the state government is working to reestablish control over the narrative by releasing expensive advertisements to news channels filmmakers have been encouraged to make films to highlight the state ’ s government ’ s coronavirusrelated health operations Arindam Sil a top filmmaker has started directing a movie titled Ek Din Jhor Theme Jabe One day the Storm will End The lines interestingly are from a poem penned by Mamata Banerjee herself Some of the TMC MPs Nursat Jahan and Mimi Chakraborty will act in the film But in reality movies—claim critics—will not work Worse the fact that authorities in Bengal are slowing down the detection of coronavirus cases with a cumbersome bureaucratic testing process is in turn putting health workers at risk So while the rest of India is trying to keep the disease at bay Mamata is composing poems and giving orders to make movies Keep watch India this is the experiment that everyone was talking about but no one had the guts to implement herd immunity at the cost of lives Screw TMC they are going to murder millions

This does nt mean anything Montagnier is an idiot antivaxxer and defends faux science like homeopathy and James Watson one of the people who won the Nobel for discovering the structure of DNA is a crusty old white racist man It s called the Nobel disease It s represented by a remarkably short time between receiving the Nobel Prize and saying something really stupid about a field in which the recipient has little experience

I m badly hit from atleast end of February Work has dried up No new opportunities I m living of my savings Skilling up with some courses and hoping for the best If things do nt go well I m considering taking up a job when all this is over How about you How are you impacted Are you getting regular work What are your plans for the future Is it wise to continue with freelancing or is it better to take a job I read at many places that world will start to work more remotely from home Any thoughts
2020-04-19 23:18:06
Former freelancer here do some small gigs here and there but primary source of income is different Yes work is harder to come by since everyone is in lockdown and the economy is fucked Learnt this the hard way to not put all my eggs in one basket Have been saving and stock trading since had a very rough start but things are okay now Future plans are to build products and market them that can cater to a world where lockdown will be a part of life for the near future As well as conceptualze products for a postlockdown post Covid market Depends on the type of freelance work you re doing If you re building websites apps that boat has sailed long ago It is better to look for a job in such circumstances If you re experienced in building automated solutions you can even charge a premium post lockdown A lot of office work will eventually shift to remote work and coupled with some basic automation even a lot of factory and industrial work will be partially from home with minimal staff at the plant Do nt expect this to happen in India anytime soon though
How about you How are you impacted I doubled downed on my Freelancing and went looking for more clients and work and was able to land a few big ones just as the lockdown was imposed I quit my day job and serving my notice period from home this month My company wanted to retain me so I let them retain me as a freelancer after my contract ends with them Are you getting regular work What are your plans for the future Yes For the next few months the plan is to do the best work for my current clients and keep looking for more work on the side Right now I am doing good financially but I m serving only a few clients and it s always better to diversify but at least I m in the position to pick and chose now Is it wise to continue with freelancing or is it better to take a job I would say it depends on what you do I work in a niche where the market is filled with a lot of lowquality freelancers so most clients want to retain me as I ve worked really hard to become really really good at what I do I read at many places that world will start to work more remotely from home Any thoughts Yes the office I used to work at will continue to operate at people physically in the office even after the lockdown ends for at least months and then they ll reconsider Since I m working with them as a freelancer my entire setup will be completely remote going forward

They were not expecting the baby because they were given a date in May and we re in search of a doctor because woman was experiencing the pain Also Dr Ramya said that the couple did not have any money with them either and they did not speak Kannada and they hesitated to speak with most people After both the baby and mother were stable Dr Ramya said that she called for an ambulance which took them to KC General Hospital Whatever happened with them is pretty sad and tragic and thank god the mother and the baby boy are fine now but do nt you think that unawarenesslack of knowledge caused more trouble in this than the lockdown itself

Is it true a lot of live Chicken is being injected with growth hormones and other substances harmful to humans
I have been hearing alot that the chicken we eat is usually being injected with hormones to make them grow quickly and become fatter I think I have even read some newspaper reports on this and am hearing the substances they inject are very harmful for us A lot of people in our family have stopped consuming chicken due to this I was actually following a diet and as I wanted most of my calories to be protein chicken breast is the best source for protein but this injection thingy has me worried And I do nt even know of any other food sources which contain as much protein grams as chicken breast
2020-04-19 22:35:21
NO The cost of hormones is costlier than the bird itself Already the cost of production is so high why will anybody increase the cost by adding hormones ” YES The antibiotics used in livestock and poultry feeds are chlortetrachyline procaine penicillin oxytetracycline tylosin bacitracin neomycin sulphate streptomycin erythromycin linomycin oleandomycin virginamycin and bambermycin These are used against virus and bacteria affecting poultry Researchers found that twothirds of the farms reported using antibiotics for growth promotion These farms were also nearly three times more likely to report multidrug resistant bacteria than those that did not use antibiotics for growth promotion
No hormones rather a end of line antibiotic called Colisitin what it does is lets their bodies focus purely on growth while fightining of all possible infections India did ban Colistin sometime last year but larger chicken farmers are still using it sneakily Venky s being the biggest culprit The issue is with high consumption you will end up with antibiotic resistance What you can do is get locally raised country or desi chicken from local butchers instead of prepackaged meat Make sure to casually ask them where the birds are from before making a purchase I would stay away from Broilers since they are the most abused breed
Antibiotics Not hormones Same with farmed fish Here and almost everywhere

Do you guys know any resolved issue faced by the Congress government that was very minor and got resolved very easily
It can be an economic policy too See me and a few other people are thinking of organizing an MUN after the lockdown and corona are over so we would be having an AIPPM committee too though some of us were against it due to the current political situation in the country and the fact that it will be organised in a very politically active campus so we want to avoid any controversy There must have been an issue that was interesting but not controversial that has been resolved since during the rule of the Congress party Edit so my team thought that we could probably work with issues that have nt been resolved as of yet and are non controversial so it would be a great help if issues like that can be suggested

Being a teacher no one s first priority Will India ever grow
What we know that everyone in India wants to become a doctor or engineer some who wants to serve nation choose civil services But no one choose to become a teacher Some who choose to become teacher by choice they open a coaching centre in greed So remaining those who have become teacher are not by choice they are just going there for few hours to earn money and not putting real effort Because of not enough competition in this sector we are not able to generate best teaching potential from ourselves It s effect would be seen in the long term When we see in the elementary education we do nt have good teachers with liberal views and professional ethics What students will see they learn and grow with similar stereotypes Will India ever grow in Intangible terms Cause tangible numbers are fake because of improportionate wealth distribution
2020-04-19 21:57:14
It s not just the teachers You require a variety of interventions to grow be it from policy making incentivizing providing necessary infrastructure and facilities ensuring proper implementation etc It s a huge cycle
Do you see how students are treating their teachers in online classes

I ll be graduating soon and I wanted to start something of my own now that getting a job after this pandemic will be a humongous task I was thinking about exporting goods to African countries where they lack baisc necessities my idea is to arrange goods from across different countries where I can get them for cheap and export it to those countries in need Example Clothes footwear grains sugar etc The part I need guidance with is how do I select a country and commodity How do I get started And is this idea even worth it Please suggest something Thank you

Huge opportunity there But Africa is a highrisk highprofit game Most banks will not give you an LC if you are exporting to Africa To begin with look at Nigeria Go there spend time speak with people and make your contacts Relying on someone for the sake of it will be the biggest mistake you can make
First You need a friend or contact in that country Secondly That contact need to setup a supply chain there or talk to dealers there to buy your products and distribute throughout Last need to open a company and you can start doing it

Milk Production and Consumption in India
With the enforced lockdown and businesses shut down milk consumption must have reduced significantly Since milk production is something that yo ca nt control in a flexible manner what is happening to the large amount of milk that is produced Also since the demand has dropped why have nt the prices

Here s something I found
Also since the demand has dropped why have nt the prices We are into the fourth week of lockdown Milk is still delivered to homes As milk is essential supply organized supply chains hasnt taken much hit
Yup It has reduced There was a news story from Kerala where the Milma Union of Malabar region bought only lakh litres of milk a day as opposed to the normal lakhs putting a lot of dairy farmers in trouble Do nt know what s happening there now could be more of the same Ca nt be helped though Major consumers are office coffee machines They re not working so demand will certainly be muted

NSFW maybe What was always ubiquitous in schools but people do nt like to talk about
I wanted to say some memories from early school Nothing shocking just normal things thoughts What do you make of your frameofmind when you used to go to school as in before class Sometimes talking to people in my college or other places I feel that they ve forgotten our point of view from even the recent past And everyone just accepts that kids are naive in one way Everything s normal if we just accept that we re worse today than how we used to be when we were that little So is it right Whatever age you are now you probably remember having choice when you were half your age do nt you If you re a bigger sibling or a parent reading this do you wory that you ca nt do enough for the kids You may have gone to a good school or not at all who knows really what is worse but school like I remember was never a place where I went to study good things like math and science and geography Everyday we playacted the Lord of the Flies These thoughtsmemories are not in any order I m just writing them as I remember off the top of my head In your experience when did you first notice developing hierarchies in schools and not caused by the administration directly My earliest memory is from when I was in class or There was in my class one student who was a repeater so he was older and taller than the rest us All the other boys looked up to him My parents never gave me a phone or a computer even until much later and I was not bright either so I was impressed by anyone that seemed to have a clue In this class and being in the coolonly group we played cricket and football in break time and other time we sniffed dendrite and whitener and the obvious things you can guess while the adults had no clue or did nt care what went on in the last benches I learned also that I could make the best grades in class easily when I focused my mind which was nt easy Did the faculty keep the rooms clean Many times in empty classrooms there was left in one corner or inside a desk empty pepsifantatype bottles into which someone had ejaculated This kind of usual stuff like also the fan blades being bent etc happened from midschool to maybe class There s some version of this everywhere This one I ve only heard from others Some guy peed in or spat in someone s waterbottle and put it back in the victim s school bag Do you agree with the notion that some cousin of racism has always been present in our schools even from the first day I do nt remember that far back but as far as I can I call it by that name Like if we can think of the worst racist bigot in politics and multiply that by there s the equivalent of the classmates I had growing up haha It s funny saying it that way It s cute now that we get outraged when some public personality lets out a distasteful opinion I hate it too but I wish we stopped acting surprised From what I remember growing up in our schools people s skin colour weight speech impediment financial status any disability was always fair game And the teacher s were not innocent They used racial slur s all the time and strangely there were some teachers who were plain cruel People who come straight out of a horror movie Umm it just seemed odd that for no reason at all a teacher would twist someone s surname into something nastysounding or pull a sardar joke out of his ass while waiting for the bell to ring We would haze very badly anyone who is gay I was so dumb that I thought for sure that gay means something bad because of a Aamir Khan movie I saw In school there was only one person who explicitly identified in this way I never got a chance to say sorry Even when that person would cry we would come again the next day and call him names and attach his name with some other guy and bully Beats me that we got away with this In class or I think sometimes our subject teacher was absent Other teachers started to popin from timetotime to check and punish anyone that was out seat Students invented were weird ways to pass the boredom like one that went like this Because we could nt go anywhere the dare part of the truthordare game was removed and the truthteller had to now compulsorily pick from one of the options The only point was to humiliate a new guy by making him say stupid shit Always it s the same question whose dick would you suck The older players pressured the new guy until he said some other guy s name Then the older players say something like but why not this other one what s wrong with this color Then the new seemingly straight guy tries to clarify and digs his own grave while the rest egg him on Kinda weird we came up with this prank Freud would ve something to say about this One girl from where I worked told me this In elementary grade her best friend girl had facial hair slightly excess Her conservative parents sent her to school to study and not focus on fashion One day her classmates teamed up and secretly drew a face with large moustache with chalk and wrote her name on blackboard Everyone saw this and laughed at her and she cried This happened in front of the teacher and the full class they had some loadshedding situation that allowed opportunity for this particular prank After this incident she never went back to that school Do nt worry she s still alive She felt very hurt and convinced her parents then they pulled strings to tranfer her to different school Maybe she was holding her depression for long time and what was funny for others was unbearably hurtful unrelated but have you seen that funny video of the penis cat permanent marker prank on the teacher This is my memory from class or I still feel angry if I think of it I do nt care now I guess I had got the feeling that a gym teacher was following me around in school He was a grey haired stoutish guy who also taught karate or something to students It was not a overt tag you re it kind of following That s why I never told anyone because it s very strange and I think no one will believe me I just saw this asshole appear out of nowhere like right beside me talking to another teacher or near the door or any entrance and talking to another teacher right at the moment I was walking past it Every morning after chapel when we lined up to go back to class he seemed to somehow end up in line ahead or behind from me either immediately or there was one or two students between us I did nt know who to complain to or what I will say in the complain He was wellrespected in school as he was involved whenever charity event or activity happened He did nt make eye contact or anything but you have no idea what that felt like when suddenly I saw him crossing my classroom on any days for no reason This creepy behaviour was making me depressed day by day After class the classes were in different building in different location in the city I was relieved to never have to see this creep again Now that I m in college even though I m living in different city I wish I meet him randomly on the street sometime because I ll kick the living shit out of him My classmates and I had heard of planchettes and that stuff for the first time in class We are very dense especially I Anyway there was this fainting techniquetrend whateveritscalled that we had heard recently A person had to perform a few moves I do nt think it s necessary that I list our version here and this would cause them to passout probably due to lack of oxygen in the brain or something One of my friends volunteered or maybe we evilly coaxed him into it That evening the seven of us went to a friend s home to test if the fainting thing actually works In the friend s room it was now night We stood surrounding him just far enough that he would nt fall and break his neck and die but really we were not paying attention because we doubted it would even work On the third attempt he suddenly started walking and jumped from the top of a staircase straight to the bottom The rest of us almost shit our pants and for a few seconds we froze instead of running to help our friend Only I went to check the corpse but when I reached the landing our friend had begun to get up on his own He had this cool new gash above his eye and blood dripping and just stared at me wondering why we were staring back at him like we d seen a ghost He had no memory of jumping or fainting or the pain of the forehead splitting We went together the six of us to hospital one of the guys called a taxi and went home I thought he literally shat himself and got his forehead stitched up Is there memories from your school life that you think other people wo nt believe you

People in junior middle school were randomly homophobic in my school Stopped in senior school largely I suspect most kids do nt understand what they re saying This was in a reputed all boys school in a big city Also we used to have tryouts for catch catch and hand cricket during break time
The worse kind of bullying I feel bad for is for some kids labelled as bayla if they had some effeminate behaviour I also might have done that and I feel bad that j would never get to apologize for that I hope schools today are better places

Who are we testing right now
I ’ ve seen for over a week now our growth in COVID cases has been constant at cases per day neither decreasing nor increasing at all Earlier in March our main of objective was testing NRIs foreigners and people who came in direct contact with them and that should be almost over considering it ’ s been a month since we ’ ve closed off the borders except some Jamat escapees who ’ re still hiding Yet we still don ’ t have enough test kits for masstestings even if government has been saying it ’ ll start testing for community transmission soon enough since March Makes me wonder who ’ re are we testing right now Are we just testing random people who can bribe or pay for private testings Which might explain why we ’ ve very low positive cases and death compared to other countries despite our very low recovery rates
2020-04-19 20:09:17
It was positive cases on th April So I guess we are picking up the pace of testing
It s all covered up India has never the finance not the expertise to test everyone in the country Each testing kit costs k and is imported Imagine the costs Resting is only done for people with a travel history abroad or who have come in contact with people who have traveled A lot of people with no history or contact with people travelling abroad are testing positive but if the government declares community transmission it will create a mass panic and will require more kits thereby crippling the economy due to extending the lockdown once again

I wo nt deny I have nt seen many moviesshows on Rural India but most tend to be overdramatic reliant on getting views out of depicting unrealistic depressing lives and problems Panchayat is simple and sophisticated I m not a casual show watching person but this was entertaining It subtly brings out some real problems infused with humor The best part was it showed people for who they are Content with whatever they have living simple easygoing lives For people who ve liked Swades and Lagaan in the past this is a unique take on a similar theme and a must watch

Planning to move to another rented apartment after rd May
In Thane Maharashtra The government has vaguely defined some services will be allowedI wanted to know if AC repai and Movers will be available I checked Urban Clap and they do nt have Electricians and AC repairs listed under Essential Services yet
2020-04-19 19:17:00
If you can hold off the move for now Or consider paying a nominal rent to hold on to the new flat no one s really going to come house hunting now One there a good chance restrictions will continue especially in MH Secondly an extension of the nationwide lockdown is possible too Lastly ac and packers do nt qualify as esstlential services If you even hire a truck and ask them to get a few labourers to help each of them would need a pass which is easier said than done
Lockdown will most likely be extended further

Airlines to refund passengers but why Indian Railways won ’ t be able to refund about Rs crore

2020-04-19 18:51:25

Airline approved my refund and send to MakeMyTrip as I booked my flight from their website but now all that refund money is in MMT wallet which I can not send it to bank account

COVID Outbreak Associated with Air Conditioning in Restaurant Guangzhou China and what steps India could take keeping this in mind
Abstract During January –February an outbreak of novel coronavirus disease in an airconditioned restaurant in Guangzhou China involved family clusters The airflow direction was consistent with droplet transmission To prevent the spread of the virus in restaurants we recommend increasing the distance between tables and improving ventilation Source post Personally I think we need to give importance to the fact that there are summer viruses and winter viruses and they need different combinations of temperaturehumidity Source Humidity best if between and It is assumed that temperature and humidity modulate the viability of viruses by affecting the properties of viral surface proteins and lipid membrane source Relative humidity RH or Saturation Ratio the state of vapor equilibrium in room air affects all infectious droplets with respiratory viruses independent of their source respiratory tract or aerosolized from any fluid and location in air or settled on surfaces Relative humidity therefore affects all transmission ways but has the most pronounced effect on airborne transmission source Measurements of indoor humidities in residential apartments in New York and in highquality commercial buildings in the Midwest showed indoor vapor pressure of below mb or indoor RH of below in the winter source Experiments conducted in a study indicated a striking correlation of the stability of winter viruses at low RH – while the stability of summer or allyear viruses enhanced at higher RH source Therefore while our population size educationawareness and density are strong disadvantages to us maybe there is some advantage to be had if we stop using airconditioning entirely for the duration of the pandemic wherever possible This is speculation but I believe it merits proper investigation
2020-04-19 18:48:20
Well I m seeing that being done here All the ATMs in my locality has their ACs turned off and doors kept open Supermarkets ca nt operate without ACs because they lack natural ventilation but masks have been made mandatory to enter the store Plus their doors are now kept open All the other shops like Pharmacy and all keep their doors opened and ACs turned off as well

Have flight bookings with Spicejet Goair for May end June beginning Losing entire money with cancellation any way out
I have flight bookings of multiple tickets for May end and return for June first week All are domestic bookings with spicejet and go air and done through make my trip Now when I go to cancel the bookings as we are not going to risk travel even if lockdown is lifted I am unable to cancel go air at all as there is not option and spicejet is having no refund policy Any way out or I just lost k completely
2020-04-19 17:36:01
Unfortunately MayJune are still days away and no one can be sure what the situation will be at the time There are reports saying that domestic flights will resume from May rd So one can expect some form or normalcy towards the end of May As of now airlines are refusing to fully refund customers who booked flights during the lockdown period if they choose to cancel so you can imagine their attitude when there is no lockdown If you must cancel do so with the knowledge you will lose money If you do not want to travel at that time see if you can postpone your trip to a later date This can help mitigate your loss to an extent
I doubt the lock down will extend till the end of may and you might even start to see some normalcy by may end june So I dont think you can cancel without penalty If i were you i would call them and see if you can postpone the travle date to a later time Or you could do nothing on the off chance lockdown extents to whenever you are traveling hence getting a full refund
If your flight gets cancelled because of lockdown on its own you will get refunded You ll get an sms wether to shift booking cancel etc Happened the same with me for Go Air

Maharashtra government is thinking about testing anti malarial drug in the slums of Mumbai any thoughts
Government has proposed to chose a target group who will receive this treatment what do you guys think it shows The helplessness of a government who is running out of options to control this pandemic or a government who chooses slums and poor people as human Guinea pigs who have no choice
2020-04-19 16:33:17
According the studies I ve read that drug does nothing in severe cases and has no immunity inducing effect either So why test it on those who do nt have Corona
They have many options use private hospitals capacity too make up agreements with less affected states to accept their patients build new govt hospital capacity explore basic careathome options for less severe cases to avoid hospitalization They also have the option of calling for volunteers As I understand even the ICMR s guidelines say it should be given to severe cases only where there s nothing left to lose So this policy of giving it as an unproven preventive medicine is a case of using poor healthy people as guinea pigs and possibly inducing some other side effects in some vulnerable individuals

Are nt there a number of mobile apps that already provide instant loans Although they charge a huge interest rate with a short loan period
I will give one example to you Before Airbnb travelers had little choice but to pay high prices for a hotel room and property owners couldn ’ t easily and reliably rent out their unoccupied space Airbnb saw untapped supply and unaddressed demand where others saw nothing at all The same is true of private car services Lyft and Uber Few people imagined that it was possible to build a billiondollar business by simply connecting people who want to go places with people willing to drive them there We already had state licensed taxicabs like Meru fasttrack etc and private limousines only by believing in and looking for secrets could you see beyond the convention to an opportunity hidden in plain sight The same reason that so many internet companies including Facebook are often underestimated their very simplicity is itself an argument for secrets If insights that look so elementary in retrospect can support important and valuable businesses there must remain many great companies still to start You can ’ t find secrets without looking for themwe want to change the future of credit If you think something hard is impossible you ’ ll never even start trying to achieve it Belief in secrets is an effective truth The actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find but they will yield only to relentless searchers Like you me who are creating cult EVERY ONE OF TODAY ’ S most famous and familiar ideas was once unknown and unsuspected The mathematical relationship between a triangle ’ s sides for example was secret for millennia Pythagoras had to think hard to discover it If you wanted in on Pythagoras ’ s new discovery joining his strange vegetarian cult was the best way to learn about it Today his geometry has become a convention a simple truth we teach to grade schoolers billion humans can not access basic credit services and fewer than of citizens in developing economies have ever taken a loan from a financial institution In many economies generations of people are governed by a dark underworld of illegal lending a pseudoeconomy ran by gangsters and fraudsters For these billion people the idea of accessing enough credit to buy a home or start a business is a pipe dream The credit problem is a fundamentally interesting one because it involves a market that is incredibly unequal and blatantly opaque Despite the fact that these inefficiencies squander the potential of billions nobody questions the status quo of credit In a world of globalization the credit industry is far from global In countries rich and poor access to credit is a fundamental cornerstone of social mobility No matter your age gender language or nation credit is the key driving force to boosting prosperity From a newlywed couple looking to settle down and buy their first home to an aspiring entrepreneur looking to start a small business virtually every human on the planet depends on credit It is the gateway to financial inclusion and ultimately financial freedom That s our company secret
I m not sure of the rules in India but banks in the US I work for one are only allowed to use specific information for the loanapproval process Data points like gender age etc are a strict nono as you could be accused of being biased despite the fact that your model is better at predicting defaults given these inputs as well Another concern of mine is regarding the use of AIML models Since these are essentially black boxes justifying how the model works is next to impossible You can explore techniques like PDLGDEAD modeling I m not too informed about the Indian banking situation perhaps someone else could shed some light

Online Classes
So guys Im in college roght now final year and because they need to get rid of us due to our placements they have started online classes and even proposed online exams While I praise the thought they have failed tp realise that me amongst many others have very limoted internet access Moreover allegedly they are even taking attendance Online classes are scheduled from am to pm every day and as I said me amongst many others do not have that data We obviously can not have broadband installed right now Many do not even have the option of installing broadband as they are from villages etc I tried tweeting out and mailing the MHRD but no reply on either fronts Professors are kind of a prude and they are petulant about attendance and all Could you suggest a few options as to what I could do
2020-04-19 14:57:12
Same condition with me dude I ve got exams day after tomorrow many students do nt have proper acces to internet and these braindead morons who ca nt even spell Corona correctly wan na take exams online
Which college
Some options Mail the professors personally and ask your friends to do the same Tell them your e sick and ca nt possibly attend class Also how do they take attendance Maybe you can ask your friends who have internet access to join in the class as you and get the attendance ie proxy just online As someone suggested try the classes on mobile It ll take less data for sure and you can maybe tweak some settings to save some data Also you can maybe ask your parents to talk to the profs They will take them more seriously

Since some people actually believe Mamata is worse than Modi lets s see how she compares to the other CM candidates from the other parties of the state
Adhir Chowdhury Congress I actually dont mind him He has done fairly good work in his LS constituency fairly consistently The issue is with Congress They were last in power in the state in under then CM Siddhartha Shankar Ray who hinted down and killed Naxals throughout the state mercilessly and the police regularly arrested and tortured young men and teenage boys even if they were innocent My own relative from my mom s side was tortured he still suffers from PTSD and Nerve disorders today After losing to CPM at the start of their year old rule on Bengal only the young and rising Youth Congress leader Mamata Banerjee kept them relevant in the state until she got fed up with the party central command and left to create TMC in So for years Congress is the most irrelevant big party in the state Since they have tried to create some alliance with CPM and so thats they only way they can come to power a secondary to a CPMINC coalition under a CPM CM Surja Kanta Mishra CPM A Physician by profession he might be a good person but as like all other Communist leaders the Party line decide his politics So again the issue is with the Party CPM Now i am gon na quote a FANTASTIC comment made by another user a month ago fairly regularly in the rest of this post So credit to him for these parts The communists arrived with the promise of giving farmers and labourers their dues Strong trade unions were formed to fight for their rights Industrialists were pressured to increase wages and provide better working conditions But unfortunately this just made the situation worse The industrialists had no money to do all that already their businesses were suffering As a result Hartals Lockdowns Strikes most of the industries that had survived were forced to shut shop due to labour unrest and you had hundreds and thousands of people without any jobs Quite often these jobless youths were employed by the Communist party as their cadres leading to the very strong grassroots cadrebased politics of West Bengal still surviving today By the time the government realised their mistake it was too late No industrialist would even come near Bengal given the history of labour unrest This also coincided with the Manmohan Singh led economic reforms of the Central government which opened up India to foreign investors These investors came and set shop in other states who would want to do business in a communist state When Jyoti Basu retired the new brigade of CPI M decided they had to do something to stop the rot Again their efforts backfired They tried too hard to reassure industrialists to invest in Bengal leading to Nandigram and Singur unrests both were cases where the government tried to take land forcibly from the farmers and hand it to industries Singur agitation ran from late early peaking in late with the Tapasi Mallik rape and murder case my first taste of student politics happened at this time when about of us did a sitin to protest and the first time I was detained by police in my first year of college Nandigram agitation reached it s peak with police firing on protesters on th March This outraged all Bengalis In Lok Sabha elections the Left Front tally in WB went down from to Then in Assembly elections Left Front which had won out of seats in could manage only In a strange irony the Communist government was defeated resoundingly for the mistake of taking land from peasants and selling it to private industrialists So ya CPM hasnt changed one bit since The moment they come to power they will start selling off fertile farm land at basically free prices to industrialists again ruining farmers again Personally i hope CPM just dies Dilip Ghosh BJP Obviously he comes from the Genocidal Muslim hating Hindutva thumping party known as BJP But he is THE WORST BJP leader worse than Modi and Amit Shah Why do i say that Lets take a look at the articles Bengal BJP Chief Wants Protesters Shot Like Dogs Babul Supriyo Says Remark Irresponsible Aadhaar PAN Cards Not Proof Of Citizenship Dilip Ghosh Nothing Wrong With People Bursting Firecrackers Dilip Ghosh BJP West Bengal President Indian breed of cows has a special characteristic there is gold mixed in its milk that is why colour of their milk is slightly yellow Cow s navel helps in producing gold with help of sunshine Dilip Ghosh West Bengal BJP President Didi s Mamata Banerjee police did nt take action against the people who destroyed public properties as they are her voters Our govt in UP Assam and Karnataka has shot these people like dogs West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh threatens Trinamool leaders ‘ There will be encounters ’ lakh Muslim infiltrators will be chased out of India if needed BJP s Dilip Ghosh BJP s Bengal Top Leader Dilip Ghosh Yes we are dividing Hindus and Muslims if you have the guts try to stop us Many died in notes ban queues why not ShaheenBagh shocker by BJP s Dilip Ghosh Thank stars nothing else was done Dilip Ghosh after woman heckled at BJP rally On cam BJP s Dilip Ghosh turns away ambulance during a rally Those people who want this piece of shit to become WB CM because you dont like Mamata get yourselves checked Mamata Banerjee TMC I will again quote the comment above by but i will add some stuffs of my own too The incident took place on July when Mamata Banerjee then state President of Indian Youth Congress the youth wing of the Indian National Congress in West Bengal organised a protest march to Writers Building the seat of then communistled Government of West Bengal They demanded voter photoID cards be made mandatory to ensure free and fair polling However around AM one kilometre before the building they were intervened by the state police near Metro cinema on Mayo Road and Dorina Road crossing at Esplanade The police fired at them resulting in the death of people and several injuries She took a bullet to the stomach for protesting for something rightful on the orders of then CM Jyoti Basu Her day fast protesting against the CPM on the Singur incident was also very important So TMC came to power and Mamata became the CM years ago Unfortunately years is too short a time to right what happened over the past years Has she done everything she could to better Bengal s economy No she has nt But she has tried For the first few years it seemed we were going back to s and s with a lot of promises made but nothing happening on ground But over the years her effort has shown One of the major things she did right was to appoint some good capable professionals and politicians to important ministries like finance industries labour agriculture urban development and filling the rest with chamchas and career politicians As a result economy civic planning tourism etc has seen excellent development in the past decade The biggest thing for me that I have seen is the patient planning and the setting up of grounds before moving in with a major policy Another thing that gets lost in the minority appeasement rhetoric is the work that has been done for the tribals and indigenous people She has also done excellent work for social welfare especially for girls Her Kanyashree project scholarship to girls from poor families as long as they are not forcefully married before they are and as long as they attend schools along with a one time grant of rupees when the girl turns has done wonders in Bengal It has reduced child marriage and increased literacy amongst girls from backward communities in one go This scheme was even recognised by United Nations as the best social development scheme in the developing world People do nt talk enough about Kanyashree it is one of the best things to happen in Bengal in my lifetime ​ Is Bengal doing great today No not at all There s still loads of problems that need to be addressed Has her rule been clean and corruption free Absolutely not Is Bengal free from political violence Again noHas she done enough Probably not ​ But we are heading towards the right direction albeit slowly Bengal is not going to be prosperous overnight there are loads and loads of issues and she has successfully tackled quite a few of them Overall I would say she has done more good than harm which is not something you can say about most governments in India NOTE Kanyashree Scheme For Girls In Bengal Wins UN Award I actually believe Mamata Banerjee is amongst the best CM s of the state of all time after Dr Bidhan Chandra ray Every one else did FAR more harm for the state than good Also as seen above she is THE LEAST EVIL of the choices and she is clearly not a Genocidal Maniac like your beloved Modi No Genocidal Maniac takes a bullet for whats right As such i am a fan of her even if she has done some questionable and bad things PS What i left out Its called Syndicate In short After the Partitions the local panchayets and whats was left of zamindars along with some local muscles teamed up to form a power structure that dictated everything that happens locally They decided everything of their local area This system spread through out the state After Bidhan Chandra Ray died Bangla Congress then named branch of Bengal INC basically took the leaders of such groups under their own party banner Some of them were even given Party tickets and actually officially became leaders of their said areas Just before CPM came in power in majority of these groups switched sides to CPM and became CPM cadres as they were called NOTE CPM actually actively discouraged caste politics and encouraged class politics AND made these groups follow it which is why caste politics is not prevalent in Bengal despite heavy casteism Same said groups switched sides to TMC in before they won And then they came to be known as Syndicate Its very much clear that whichever party holds these tiny power groups are actually able to become the state rulers

Unfortunately years is too short a time to right what happened over the past years Same excuse the bhakths giving for Modi I like your interesting take on Mamata where you ve conveniently ignored the following Corruption Only Mamata bhakths believe that she and her party members had nothing to do with the Sarada scam Or the other chit funds The cases are still pending and the money is totally gone Whatever money was returned to the few was taken out from the state funds A bridge collapsed in the middle of city and tmc government did nt bat an eye Trifala scam has started again There s too many to list here but do check what Abhishek Banerjee has been doing for the last few years Intolerance Calling students Maoists and arresting them Arresting professors and putting them behind bars without fair trial for posting a simple meme Police violence in JU Torturing civil service officers to suicide Lies and Jumla park street rape case The accused escaped and his gf who aided his escape was taken into the party Mamata assassinated the character of the rape victim just to give a clean chit to the accused Everyone forgot that it seems In this regard care to elaborate what s she s doing with the covid testing to hide the numbers Social media is rife with tells of how people are being turned away from hospitals and that s not bjp propaganda I m receiving news from my friends who are doctors that there s state sponsored propaganda to hide the numbers Mamata even went as far to forcefully audit the deaths to comorbid conditions so that the covid report can be suppressed Funny thing is unless there s comorbid conditions you ll not even die from covid that does nt mean it s not spreading Industrial output pray tell what Mamata has done to improve the state s industrial output Where are the jobs We ve all been hearing the empty lies from the biswa bangla summit how many of the those projects ever came to fruition Minority appeasement while Modi is trying to get rid of muslims Mamata is doing the opposite going as far as to ignore the criminal elements in the society to pander to that votebank The attack on doctors that sparked a protest across the country was fueled by the simple fact that Mamata did nt have the guts to arrest the criminals because they were Muslims even when the rational Bengali Muslim community tried denouncing them over and over She has given the statement that those who came from Bangladesh and have voted are now citizens even if they have come recently what the fuck Mamata does nt get to decide who gets citizenship We do nt want Bangladeshis here no matter if they are Hindu or Muslim Her government had even shielded war crime convicts just to get some brownie points Why There s no difference between Modi and Mamata except the fact that while the first one is trying to get rid of the Muslims the second one was trying to alleviate them to a godlike status one imam from a Bengali masjid gave the statement a few years ago that the Muslims will decide who gets to become the CM of WB Other than that the lies and jumla are just as widespread the corruption just as deep The only reason Mamata gets away with all this is because Bengal has became irrelevant in the national stage No one gives a shit Else she s just as corrupt and authoritarian as Modi And if talking about the developments these are all being done with a single strategy Destroy Bengal s industrial output evict all the educated folks so whoever left becomes solely dependant on the state for their livelihood Meanwhile she and her goons can continue ruling the state like the left has done for last decades That s all there is to it Bengali s have no hope left It s TMC or BJP and both are cancerous in their own ways Only chance is for an Arvind Kejriwal to rise but that s probably never gon na happen Most educated and literate bengali s are leaving the state who s gon na rise to the occasion
There should be a trade off between socialism and Capitalism Something in between so everyone can benefit
Mamta is as bad and as authoritarian as Modi it s just resticted to the state level The media is mostly under her control hence you do nt get to see too much bad or negative press on her During this crisis itself Bengal has the lowest testing rates in India alongwith active suppression of cases She has actively threatened and jailed individuals and journalists for speaking out against her or even questioning her She is the reason that Tata Nano factory had to leave Bengal in late s When TMC came into power all the goons from CPM shifted to TMC You should look up her nephew he is corrupt to the core Bengal has a lot of potential which has never been realized Bengal is stuck in the past with no intention of arriving in the th century

Could Covid increase the average scientific understanding in Indians
After we overcome this situation let s say in will more Indians be able to appreciate science and research more than magical thinking I am finding it difficult to predict which way we will turn For example my dad is frustrated that the vaccine is not going to be ready for to months But I thought the world s science and technology was far more advanced So what will it be in future More respect of science and medical knowledge that humans have wrested from a silent universe Or disillusionment with science
2020-04-19 14:27:26
No
No way Most of the folk still swear by WhatsApp University
What do you exactly mean by disillusionment with science The greatest enemy of science in today s world is religion Religion is mostly a business designed to take advantage of human stupidity so it s not going to vanish anytime soon if you ask me The humanity is not facing a pandemic for the first time so religion wo nt be giving up easily in or whenever science develops vaccine for it In my opinion it will happen some day but not in this century at least

How China dominates tech investments in India

2020-04-19 13:43:28
A recent Indian Institute of Foreign Trade IIFT working paper authored by Sunitha Raju and V Raveendra Saradhi suggests that concerns about imports from China may be misplaced They show that between and growth in imports from China was associated with growth in gross value added GVA and output across Indian industries Of the major industries selected for the analysis GVA declined for only three industries—steam generators iron and steel and games and toys Categorizing Chinese imports into capital intermediate and consumer goods the authors found that imports of intermediate goods boosted output the most growth of followed by capital goods imports and consumer goods imports Thus the authors argue that imports of intermediate and capital goods from China have the greatest effect on the manufacturing sector Competition from Chinese imports also improved overall industry efficiency by forcing out inefficient firms and allowing efficient firms to increase their market share the researchers show In particular this has helped boost the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sector with both sectors improving their export performance India ’ s lurch towards protectionism has also meant that India ’ s integration in global value chains GVCs has suffered in recent years Between and GVC participation rate for most developing countries declined a recent World Bank report shows But the decline for India has been sharper than for others Source
Well India has nukes India can negotiate better terms from china Thing is government wants to create anti china narrative than use the sentiment gathered to employ protectionist policies which actively harm Indian businesses for the benefit of a few industrialists They always say if we remove import duties cheap Chinese goods will food market My answer is so what People are nt going to just spend money on Chinese goods unless they ve utility and if there is utility government is harming that utility by pushing anti china narrative you are harming utility of local businessespeople and reducing their quality of life Increasing inflation Russia has free trade agreement with China Russia is nt going bankrupt Austrlia has too and Malaysia too Nothing dries up economy like imposing misplaced tariffs to prop up some industrialists over common businesses and countrymen

What HT Would nt Publish The Folly and Vanity of the Project to Redesign Delhi
Ramachandra Guha s article on The Wire Narendra Modi s project for the Central Vista was always controversial It is now absolutely untenable Six years ago the then editor of the Hindustan Times invited me to write a fortnightly column I agreed on condition that there would be no censorship While occasionally some changes to my text were made without my consent there was no attempt to get me to rewrite my column or change its arguments Until this week when the Hindustan Times declined to print the column I had sent which was scheduled to appear on Sunday April I am grateful to The Wire for carrying this column in its entirety In a twopart article published last month in the website Newslaundry the writer Alpana Kishore subjected the project to redesign New Delhi ’ s Central Vista to critical scrutiny The first part asked the question “ Why is redeveloping Central Vista a bigger priority than fixing the capital ’ s catastrophic air pollution or plummeting life expectancy ” In answering this question Kishore focused on one key element in the project the provision for a grand new house for the prime minister on Rajpath Such selfindulgence she argued may be common in dictatorships but was inappropriate for a Republic If one thinks of Delhi as akin to London or Berlin a capital of a democracy then argues Kishore spending hundreds of crores “ on a second house for the prime minister ahead of fixing Delhi ’ s pressing problems like its catastrophic air pollution which causes deaths per day and percent of all premature deaths is a spectacularly insensitive move that puts a powerful elite firmly above the people ’ s good On the other hand if we are in the BeijingPyongyangMoscow axis where citizens are passive spectators it is absolutely normal ” The second part of Kishore ’ s article focused on the process by which the project was awarded a process marked by secrecy and subterfuge ending in the contract going to a firm of architects from Gujarat known to be particularly close to the prime minister This firm ’ s previous projects wrote Kishore had depended for their execution “ upon the removal of “ obstacles ” like due process impact assessments public consultation and wellestablished global best practices ” The firm ’ s past record in sum was one of consistently manifesting “ an innate disrespect for the citizen ” In concluding her twopart essay Kishore remarked “ The biggest irony remains that a prime minister from the humblest of backgrounds should yearn for a house on Rajpath no less to endorse his vision of personal greatness and legacy Would Emmanuel Macron demand and more importantly get a house on the Champs Elysées Can even Trump order himself a second home on the Mall She added ‘ It brings back embarrassing memories of his nameembroidered Rs lakh suit only this time the vanity will be at the taxpayer ’ s expense ” Kishore ’ s essay has no mention of the COVID crisis evidently it was written before the dimensions of the crisis became known I shall come to this crisis presently but let me first state that I share her concerns entirely This project has been pushed through without wider consultation with the public or even with domain experts in architecture and urban planning In fact as one who has seen the work of this firm of architects in Ahmedabad at firsthand I have an additional concern that they are utterly indifferent to history and heritage A prime example of this was their design of a second campus for the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad The original IIMA campus designed by Louis Kahn beautifully blends traditional and modern practices using red brick open windows and courtyards It is a joy to see walk through study and teach in Its successor is cold and soulless built entirely of concrete those assigned offices there yearn for a transfer to the original and much more welcoming campus Also read In Light of the COVID Pandemic the Central Vista Project Should Be Reviewed The prime minister ’ s own justification of the project is that it was to mark not a personal but a national milestone – the th anniversary of Indian independence This is disingenuous because past anniversaries overseen by past prime ministers had not called for such a spectacular extravaganza Both the th and th anniversaries of independence had been suitably marked by a special session of parliament Apparently what was good enough for Indira Gandhi and IK Gujral wouldn ’ t quite do for Narendra Modi To my mind the Modi government ’ s redesign of New Delhi brings to mind not so much living Communist autocrats as it does some dead African despots It is the sort of vanity project designed to perpetuate the ruler ’ s immortality that Felix HouphouetBoigny of the Ivory Coast and Jean BédelBokassa of the Central African Republic once inflicted on their own countries for more on the first see VS Naipaul ’ s essay ‘ The Crocodiles of Yamoussoukro Even before the coronavirus pandemic hit us this expensive redesign of the core of the national capital seemed a wasteful and selfindulgent exercise It has now become much more so For an economy that was already flailing has been brought to the brink by the pandemic The illplanned lockdown has led to enormous human suffering Workingclass Indians already living on the edge are now faced with utter destitution As many economists have argued the millions of poor Indians rendered poorer by this crisis urgently need financial support from the Central government Why can ’ t the funds currently allocated to the Central Vista scheme – estimated at Rs crore and counting – be diverted to help ameliorate their condition Politically the burden of this economic social and humanitarian crisis is being borne by the states They desperately need money – not least the money the Centre already owes them A staggering Rs crore are still due to the states from the Centre as their share of Goods and Services Tax revenues Why does this still remain unpaid while the Central Vista project has been sanctioned and a schedule for its tendering announced Also read What a Comparison of Great Central Vistas Tells Us About Modi ’ s Plans for New Delhi It will be at least a year – probably longer – before the economy can begin to fitfully recover The restoration of the social fabric may take even longer Altogether the country may take at least five more likely ten years before it can return to where it was before COVID came to our shores Surely the moral political and intellectual energies of our leaders must be devoted above all to this economic and social rebuilding In his speeches to the nation since the pandemic broke the prime minister has repeatedly asked Indians to sacrifice – sacrifice their time their jobs their lifestyles their human and cultural tendency to be gregarious Now citizens must ask the prime minister to sacrifice something for the nation as well His project to redesign Central Vista was always controversial It is now absolutely untenable He should drop it Postscript While spiking this particular article the Hindustan Times left open the possibility of my continuing to write on other and presumably from

The Coronavirus Crisis Demands Everyone Act Responsibly So What Happened to the Media

2020-04-19 10:45:52
Some of the TV anchors that think they control the universe and guide the sun the moon and the stars in the firmament hold their daily ‘ durbars ’ in the evening They speak more than the participants and in a language which is most offensive They contribute immensely to the spread of this communal virus I wonder why some guests including spokespersons of political parties agree to participate in these programmes only to be insulted and humiliated without even getting the opportunity to have their say They only lend respectability to such channels and their anchors The ‘ Godi ’ media attacks in a herd So when you switch channels or read another newspaper you will find the same untruth repeated ad nauseam For the gullible a lie becomes truth if repeated time and again Action is taken immediately against media persons who report or write what the government does not want the people to hear So policemen will travel all the way from Ayodhya in UP to serve summons on a senior and respected journalist because he dared report how the chief minister of UP made a mockery of all norms of social distancing to personally participate in a religious programme where his presence was avoidable Yet no action will be taken against the ‘ Godi ’ media persons for spreading pure poison On the other hand they are rewarded with select leaks from the government to carry on with its ‘ agenda ’ of blaming one community for the corona ills be it the Defence Colony case in Delhi – where a Muslim security guard was quickly booked for allegedly spreading the coronavirus only for his test to come back negative – or the spontaneous mass gathering of migrant workers at Bandra in Mumbai where some channels miraculously found a ‘ Muslim ’ angle xB I am told that every evening the TV channels and the print media receive instructions from ‘ sources ’ close to the government about the subjects they have to highlight the editorial line they have to take the participants for the debates they must invite the articles which should be published and the manner in which the government ’ s achievements have to be promoted They will never question the government But while they just ignore the faults frailties and failures of the government they go hammer and tongs at the Opposition How dare the opposition or anyone else oppose the government So every evening and morning the opponents are hauled over the coals while the government ’ s failures are not scrutinised

Having a discussion with family and I am unable to explain to my parents how the death rate is so low here Is it because of the lockdown or are there some other reasons too My parents are saying it s the lockdown immunity which helped but I think there must be something more Thanks
2020-04-19 10:26:16
Each country has a different timeline Exponential growth starts at different stages in each country i think we are seeing the community transmission now in India But its hard to gauge these numbers if India is nt doing same amount tests as some of the other countries
Lockdown is a major reason No other country is implementing the lockdown with the force of police like India is They are still respecting individual rights and people s right to exist while doing the lockdown You would nt hear cases of police killing people for buying groceries in the other countries They are nt banning going out for a walk etc as long as you maintain distance
Q How come Indians dying more numbers in accidents while percapita vehicles are more in West A Conditions are different Q How come western countries are facing so many deaths with numbers going upto more than k where as India is low A Conditions are different India implemented lockdown much early than others Closed down the public places presst soon into the pandemic They took harshest measures in short time xB While Beaches are still open In USA the below atricle is from yesterday Lockdown orders are ignored by people as they didnt get them back in March Its a spring break in Northern hemi sphere its a gathering time So the people flouted the orders and kept gathering There is no paid leave in USA for many workers so they are forced to go to work in stores that attract more foot falls The numbers obviously exploded as people keep gathering Edit Test or no tests we are talking about deaths deaths are hard to hide We are seeing situations like mass burials and largescale cremations in China and west We are not seeing them in india

Unending WitchHunt of Muslims Eminent Citizens Condemn Targeted Arrests of AntiCAA Protesters

2020-04-19 10:22:51
“ Instead of engaging with the protestors the state has chosen if predictably to unleash its naked power on them detaining and arresting them under harsh penal provisions ” read the statement which also noted that “ the antiCAA protests mark a poignant moment of constitutional recovery and reclamation of the republic from a turgid and toxic hypernationalism ” It can be noted that in the last few weeks at least two antiCAA activists and members of the Jamia Coordination Committee JCC have been arrested by Delhi police for their alleged role in organising antiCAA protests which according to the police led to violence in northeast Delhi in February Moreover as per a recent report in the New Indian Express the special cell of Delhi Police which is investigating the cases related to the violence has issued notices to more than members of Jamia Coordination Committee JCC for its alleged involvement in instigating protests against CAA and National Register of Citizens NRC across the national capital Prior to the arrests of Zargar and Meeran several other antiCAA activists such as Khalid Saifi and Ishrat Jahan were arrested from northeast Delhi Similarly other activists like Sharjeel Imam Dr Kafeel Khan and Sabu Ansari have been arrested for the their role in antiCAA protests
Not surprising It s highly likely that people who were already resentful about the Government would attack the healthcare workers and policemen The arrests are absolutely justified and not a glorious witchhunt

I watch this press conference daily at around pm on Youtube One of the most common question from the press daily is how many cases have been linked to TJ Everytime the response is usually this “ Data will be shared by MHA in a separate briefing ” So he is just answering the questions being asked there everyday
Does nt it actually help muslims tho Many people are led to believe that almost all cases are because of muslimstablighi but he clarifies that are linked to tablighi while are not
To be honest I do not think there s anything wrong here It s not about banning and shaming is about being straight If of our cases are Jamaat related political correctness comes later truth first God I sound like a bhakt But in this case I think it s important We re suffering because of a superstitious cult and that needs to be mentioned again again and again They deserve the infamy The Markaz did nt just do this in India but had done the same in multiple countries

Hi I find it outrageous that during a lockdown when sometimes people are getting beaten up for going out to buy essentials a VIP celebrates his son s wedding But what I find more outrageous is their people have the guts to manipulate wikipedia and phrase it as The wedding took place on April near Janapada Loka in Ramanagara but caused controversy as it was held during the extended Janata Curfew As far as I know the janata curfew was voluntary and long back On April the lockdown and socialdistancing was in full effect But these folks are phrasing it on wiki so damn casually As if the lockdown translates to janata curfew for VIPs Is no legal action being taken against these people for violating the lockdown so blatantly If there are any wiki editors here hopefully they have the good sense to fix the phrasing in the page I linked to

You can also edit it with the right source you do nt need a wiki account This is a recent occurrence you need to give days for any page to stabilize In stable state the last line will be removed over a period of time Coming to legal action it ca nt be taken because they were well within the rules established for the Lockdown and had taken the necessary permissions
Huh I was detained because I ventured out to get a lpg cylinder for my house Damn the police
Virtual skirmishes of politicalideological nature on Wikipedia are not recent in the Indian context I ve been a wiki editor for a while and I remember seeing plenty of attempts to push a certain political narrative via misleadingoutright false narratives For some reason most people making such malicious edits seem to be ideologically rightwing when it comes to entries related to India I remember seeing this play out in the edit histories of pages like Hindu Yuva Vahini and Bajrang Dal You ll have users flatout delete parts of the article or sometimes more subtly modify just a few words to alter the context Usually stuff like this is easily spotted because these guys either do nt bother summarizing their edits or write something inappropriate like Corrected a mistake Most such shoddy attempts at defacement are reverted pretty promptly so at least the integrity of Wikipedia—with regard to threats posed by such amateur edits—is not in danger I used to keep an eye out for such things and make sure I reverted malicious edits and reported unscrupulous users but after a while it got exhausting because it s just a constant loweffort barrage of bakwaas I suppose we ought to be grateful that most people indulging in such edits are too dumb to come up with professionallooking edit summaries that pass scrutiny

Need help from Physios here…
Hello I am designing a software to help physios save some time while impacting their income positively I need some data for that Please help me with some questions The following questions are not specific to your practice but generally about physiotherapy in India Generally how many sessions does a person need for his rehab What of patients leave their therapy incomplete What would be the reasons for a patient to leave their therapy incomplete Generally how much more do home visits cost as compared to patient visiting the clinic Do physiotherapy patients have a waiting time at clinic If yes what would be the approximate time that patients need to wait for What other challenges do patients face in regards to their physiotherapy What are the challenges that physios face in their day to day business operations How often do physios have to work with multiple patients at one time How often do physios have to stretch their scheduleswork hours because of excess patients How often do physios themselves face occupational hazards like back pain neck pain shoulder pain due to manual work or physically demanding sessions How many maximum sessions can an average physiotherapist do in a month I am trying to understand the income ceiling of an average physio What are the fixed expenses per month of an average physio What are the ways that an average physio uses to cross the monthly income ceiling
2020-04-19 09:25:28
You re better off contacting physios directly and getting their feedback Look them up on practo and contact them one by one A lot of them might have free time due to the lockdown and will be down to help you out

Rahul Gandhi showed how opposition party should behave during crisis Shiv Sena

2020-04-19 09:21:01
Good we need people to work together for the nation not for selfish interests We have problems like population pollution economy and of course the most immediate one ie to deal with this pandemic
Is nt this a chide from Shiv Sena who s saying that for first time RG is properly behaving like an opposition instead of being ahem himself And from strategical Gandhi s strategical strategy talk I just heard there is strategical need for strategical strategies but strategical leader did nt strategically state what strategies he has in his strategical mind

2020-04-19 08:32:40
I heard there are talks to lift the lockdown the actions do nt add up to numbers spike what am I missing
new cases actually do not happen in hours it depends on the extent to which testing is done

Karnataka withdraws order allowing twowheelers and IT companies to work after April

2020-04-19 08:26:42
I do nt understand why they think working in offices is work only All this work can be perfectly done remotely except stringing together network cables and moving computers about IT services can function perfectly well from home
Take that fuckers who were down voting my post the other day This lax should not be taken up at any cost The bare truth is IT services can should and have been doing WFH when the lockdown started and have increased it slowly and steadily And IT industries is the only sector actually equipped to WFH And not put undue burden more so important now on the multitudes of larger population they will contact with if they are forced to come to office from th like their • own colleagues • security personnel • food Courtcanteen staff • numerous other folks on the road if needed • and police not to mention the harrasment these poor sods will face at every nook and corner especially if they are onnbikes and not cars s bit of levity I was watching this video from NDTV wherein Nasscom fuckers seem to not give two shots about these poor sods in IT I genuinely do not understand just why why do you need to take this step And cut lax to evry other stringent measure taken so far Also people who have workes in IT know this very well that even if the employee cites valid reason like heshe does nt want to risk his family s health by going outside to office the scroundels of this earth namely IT managers especially of Service sector with all their bullshit manipulation tactics will force these employees to go to office only to please their upper leadership So then IT folks just become a figure And once you force people to come to employees on th and after god forbid if something happens and the casualty number goes up again what will you they do Alas IT folks will then become a figure on the ticker which is running of people being caught with the pandemic and ultimately as pronounced dead due to COVID on some Babu s register in the annals of our great bureaucracy
the selective lock down is more appropriate then following the china model that locks down entire regions unfortunately europe and usa have followed the china model with few exceptions like sweden germany turkey and iran
