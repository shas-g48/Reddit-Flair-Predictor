is the most pathetic thing about hindunationalists their subservience to whitesupremacists
if you go onto right wing social media circles you find countless conspiracy theories that are pretty much copypasted from cesspools like stormfront or pol many about how the soros funded left wing media is unfairly critical of rightwing ideologies or how the mere existence radical islamic terrorism is justification enough to impose indiscriminate violence against muslims under any one of donald trumps tweets you will find hoards of indians venerating him and congratulating him for his policies against muslims or celebrating his friendship with modi and the wave of antichinese bigotry perpetrated by racist whites in response to the coronavirus has swept up india in such a frenzy that even indian northeasterners are not safe from attacks and harassment due to having oriental features there is such a innate desire for hindunationalists to make sure that they are on the same side of every issue as white supremacists as both of them see their own community as being inherently better than the rest and therefore united in their contempt for the rest but the one key difference between the two groups is all of this ethnonationalist bravado projected by the indian government and its hindunationalist supporters falls to the wayside when donald trump threatens retaliation against india for putting its own self interest before that of the white supremacists it s almost as if they have accepted their status as being above the chinese the muslims etc but subconsciously they have accepted the rule of the white man over them it s not a surprise that over the course of his tenure as india tries to contort and bend to appease him donald trump treats india with almost a sense of restrained contempt for many years india has taken advantage of the us in terms of trade on trade if they were to disallow the drug from being exported to the us there maybe be retaliation off course there would be retaliation on hydrochloroquine and we re supposed to say oh thank you for the library i do nt know who s using it in afghanistan on india s role in afghanistan our relationship with pakistan is a very good one thanks to these efforts we are beginning to see signs of big progress with pakistan on namaste trump in ahmedabad tariff king on india s local industries while the barrage of pettiness and hate that is reserved for countries like bangladesh malaysia turkey and others in india s more immediate neighborhood is released the moment any of them dare to say something slightly critical of india somehow this strong and aggressive hindunationalist government almost always just cowers down to the us and complies accordingly to all their threats and requests and it s not as if they do it begrudgingly their supporters continue to revere and look at the white house as a friend and well wisher

p how to deal with parents who support extreme government authoritarianism
my dad seems to be going down this path of extreme authoritarianism he gets most of his news from republic tv and is a heavy modibjp supporter recently with the jamat news we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for testing i obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished but i also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else s life my dad says they ll make this a communal affair as if he does nt have deepseated contempt for muslims so the entire judicial system should be done away with he believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks i tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to nazism or a suppressed population like in china but he believes that china is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good he also believes that the human rights violations against uyghurs in china is acceptable because and i quote they were trying to convert the chinese to islam even though he has no evidence of that even if he did have strong evidence of something like that and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow i said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful does our judicial system have flaws of course and i agree with my dad on that point but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system i m currently studying abroad in a western country where i m obviously a minority so i naturally asked him if he d support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me his son i asked him if he d be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a hindu minority me but he basically evaded that question authoritarianism works until it does nt authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression authoritarianism is okay as long as it does nt affect your views how do i explain this to him i m considering never discussing politics with him for i adore and respect my dad and i d hate to see our strong relationship degrade even a bit because of these things fml

bjps bs yeddyurappa bsy annoys the it cell and bhakts
in an interview for a local news channel the bjp cm of karnataka gave a statement along the lines of stern action will be taken against individuals who speak out against muslims and disrupt communal harmony not exactly verbatim apparently this was a burnol moment for a lot of bhakts and the it cell and a twitter hash welosthopebsy began to trend early this morning bashing the cm and asking him to step down crazy stuff but a few hours later a few sane individuals realised this and started trending westandwithbsy even though the old guard bjp folks in karnataka subscribe to the hindutwa ideology they have never been bloodthirsty or fought elections over communal issues there is a line that they draw this is in sharp contrast to a few younger leaders who are out for blood and who will do anything and everything to impress the folks up north a few changes such as addressing fellow kannada bjp leaders with a ji at the end instead of sri at the start like usually how it s done in kannada signals a bellwether

do you think india should revoke lockdown on april
personally i believe that our corona virus cases would increase exponentially after april if lockdown is revoked india s current total infected cases is and we are testing about people per day which i think is nowhere near enough united states had around cases before march and they were testing around per day during that time they increased it to about testing per day on march and their corona virus cases started exploding even if we re on lockdown plenty of incidents happened recently that might have caused mass community spreading like the nizamuddin dargah hundreds of people celebrating ram navmi despite lockdown dharavi slum incident then those massmigrations just after lockdown and on april too almost everywhere from big cities to small towns people started celebrating like it s diwali so if these incidents caused tons of new cases then they d mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over and it d started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown also if we continue with these very low rates of testings we ll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve may sources also claimed india will peak the epidemic around april first week which is far from truth but according to speculations from artificial intelligence india will peak during junejuly
2020-04-08 04:40:23
its a very complicated scenario tbh on the one hand as you said we havent done enough testing compared to other countries and considering our population we should be testing more aggressively so yes lockdown needs extension on the other hand considering economy the livelihood of daily wage workers agricultural sector and also the impact of lockdown on mental health i think it should be lifted im pretty sure the decision makers are facing similar dilemma
i d say ramp up testing rates ensure everyone has masks to wear revoke lockdown in phases

i was all set to start a software and consultancy business before the lockdown but was delayed due to a few reasons i ve used these few days under lockdown to complete a few pending things all that s remaining is to start making calls online campaigns and visiting clients people from justdial sulekha quickr are on my back every since i enquired our main product is a software built for small businesses on a subscription basis a combination of billing and management software it is ready and initial trials too were very encouraging now with all that behind i am now worried about how things will be post lockdown i mean it is obvious that there is not a lot of money in the market at this time so do i push this for later if yes how longer should i wait i have nt even registered the business at the moment just focused on product development i am open to any other advice
2020-04-08 03:06:15
with great respect to entrepreneurs like you small businesses which are your target base will have headwindchallenges for sure and in that phase of it if going for your software can help them in their operational cost reduction you will see great success try acquiring customers by giving your software as limited free in this tough times maybe an year or below your competition price if you do nt end up in loss with this approach
sell it to government

should we make a petition to declare maulana saab and the attendees of jamat who are now hiding as national terrorists
disclaimer this is nt an attack on my muslim brothers and sisters i have islamic friends who are also getting bullied because of this and i feel so so so sorry for the innocents dragged in this this is just about the attendees of jammat who are hidden let s look at this situation objectively the sole purpose of calling people to jammat and then hiding there was so that the people who do nt have the coronavirus will catch it and once that was fulfilled the people were sent to hide in places of the country they went as far as andaman and nicobar islands which is the remotest location in the country and only way to reach is by ferry only people motivated with a specific intent will do something like this because think about it you do a bombing and you might take out people but if u do this you can take out hundreds thousands even millions if not contained this was a planned attack on our beautiful nation i think that these people need to be declared as terrorists and their names and faces made public so that the people of the nation will stay wary of them edit changed a typo

this is the funny thing mate instead of following my passion early on i instead decided to focus on school and academics i was able to get a better percentage in jee mains but again i ca nt code for shit so many young kids are so ahead of me today it hurts this education system sucks ass
you do nt necessarily need a graduation degree to success in life follow your passion it will pay off let me give you my example i was never good in studies i applied for jee but did nt give it because i knew i would never get a good college which i can afford took admission for bca went to college just for one day and dropped off everyone told me that i have to go to college and have a graduation degree to success in life i disregarded them and followed my passion now i make working from home for a european tech company and you know what they did nt even ask for my education in interview nor did my previous employer when i had joined them at age of world is changing fast what matters is your skills and what you can achieve not a piece of paper
fancy college does nt necessarily mean you ll be better than other kids just keep learning what you like if you love cs sky is the limit all the resources are out there on the internet focus on improving your skills the right way you can study in any college but just do nt leave the zeal learn from the right resources coursera is a good start to learn from professors from highly reputed colleges like stanford mit etc value your time if you are not gon na endup in a fancy college that means you will have more time to vest read the right books structure and interpretation of computer programs sicp is a good first book to read although pretty old it improves your understanding of computers and programming in general follow right people read the blogs and works of computer scientists peter norvig s website is quite intriguing make a deliberate attempt to know and learn about the scientists working in your area of interest be bloody damn good at what you do your career wo nt disappoint you ps i work with colleagues who are commerce graduates and can code better than few of my so called fancy college graduates you do nt need to worry much you are infact in the right track

while i do nt find pmcares fund to be transparent at all still donated to both i do nt find that particular point to be strong the central vista one is spot on though beautification and remodelling of old monuments can take a step back for the greater good advertisement bans sound good but then it should also apply to the opposition though my concern is where will information advisories come from not a fan of sonia but she is so much more of a leader than rahul gandhi could ever hope to be

so here are the similarities genius doctors with an addiction problems house vicodin reddysingh alcohol emotionally stunted because of events that happened in the past house divorce and botched leg surgery reddy singh heartache cuz lol we re indian and we love us some drama crabby explosive personalities rude toxic etc best friends who act as moral compasses house wilson reddy singh shiva many say the indian character is angry but i think it s just angst that stems from chronic dissatisfaction and a determination to be miserable and house is pretty much the same but with a dry sense of humour we see themes of self harm play out throughout both the productions and the more house md clips i watch on youtube the more i m convinced they re comparable characters

first of all i may be terribly wrong in many things and i will gladly accept criticism the whatsapp admin arrest thing feels like the worst case of technological illiteracy almost a year ago someone i know made a simple group for discussing before exams everyone used their contacts and added people from everywhere and it was really great and helpful fast forward to a night before exam everyone was stressed and the group was silent since everyone was busy studying in these dark times the guys who are the most vella are awake one of the guys shared a meme about a historical figure and some guys got butthurt as it affected their class or something shared group link with others abused the shit out of that guy and it went on and on the admin had his phone shut due to highly obvious reasons came online hours later and removed those new people and the guy who shared the meme who was sorry about it told everyone that this group ai nt for this and deleted it as well but it was too late the people had some ties up and shared screenshot with the police they got their hands on the person who shared the meme and then the admin who has absolutely no part in this at all and a huge police case with tons of cash looking at the current situation every group is like the admin should be responsible for what happens on group and what not i heard of cases where group admins are arrested like of them as well just because some dumb forward was on their group why exactly is this dumb whatsapp does not provide any rights to a group admin apart from adding and removing people when a person is removed they can still see the group members and the chats after they are deleted a person who is deleted can still have group link and use it to add others untill it s revoked a group can have around admins from any place in india or other so according to the law or whatever is said all of those admins can be held accountable admins are usually a joke in whatsapp groups barely anyone actually respects them these issues are really solved in discord and telegram where there are very real rights provided to a moderator or an admin and i think even facebook group admins have more rights but this is clearly dumb i have even heard that some people purposely send messages which can be harmful for a group or its admin so that they would be held accountable while some have even sent messages and left the group to mentally hurt the admin and i guess that s the rant there is no real solution to it even though a better app exists no one s going to switch to it be ause some whatsapp forwards do a fantastic job of informing people that these apps are by some rival countries or dumb shit like that

we are digitally illiterate and so is our government
dumb or not the law is the law until it s changed if you are an admin of a chat group with that many admins and a lot of unknown users understand your liability large whatsapp groups are very noisy and you have no control over what can be posted or screenshotted often out of context given all this ask yourself should you continue to be admin for large uncontrollable groups

extensive testing is an insurance to avoid lockdown
singapore just had a spike of cases yesterday because of a couple of dormitories it seems like a small spark can cause a fire one of the main tools to resume partial economy for any country after the lockdown is aggressive testing and tracing until there is a treatment or vaccine several people think scaling up testing is not necessary which makes me sad i am going to make an insurancelike case for that taking india as a case some back of the envelope calculation cost of a test upto in india doing tests per day for days would cost billion this sounds like a lot until we look at the cost of lockdown which is billion for weeks so basically with the cost of a single day of lockdown we should be able to test people everyday for days and there seems to be reasonable confidence in science community that we may have a safe and effective drug for treatment by then there can be different strategies for how we will pick people for the tests per day and that s a later discussion i am more concerned about getting extensive test coverage so we can detect outbreaks early and do a much finer grained lockdown than a blunt countrywide lockdown basically pay a small cost to avoid another lockdown in the future note that the cost of test will likely go down significantly say an order of magnitude if we scale up ps i would also go further and say that we should make all international passengers who arrive get this done a few days after arrival and make them pay for it
2020-04-07 22:31:35
tests per day for days would cost billion testing is not done in thin air it needs suitable labs technicians logistics of collection equipments and so on is the cost of a test kit you forgot to price other things i would also go further and say that we should make all international passengers who arrive get this done a few days after arrival and make them pay for it this should happen singapore has been doing it
that is a mythical figure from the price cap of the usfda approved cosara kits that the government was trying to push as a de facto standard through restrictive guidelines in what many reasonably suspect to be a dodgy quid pro quo for the gujrat based sarabhai group this is not a good number to base scaleup calculations on niv already validated various test kits costing as little as to rupees and the govt buckled under pressure last week as icmr rolled back those arbitrary guidelines and approve those kits once supplychain for mass production is established we can only expect these costs to come down further rapid testing kits are also being developed which can also bring down logistical and personnel costs indirectly scaling up testing is a very achievable goal and is proven to be the only reliable way to keep the pandemic in check keeping testing free for everyone is the only way to ensure as many people as possible can be tested and fast government ineptitude and cronyism is making it look more impossible than it ought to be

govt s decision to force rbi to open it s string and payout crores way back in what do you guys think about it now
everyone might recall how rbi was forced to pay lakh crores to goi when the rest of sane class of people termed it blatant abuse of power the initial request was much higher though many experts advised not to touch the reserves as that is the war chest of india read more here but we know t present govt has its own way of dealing with oppositions not just the political so it did get the money it wanted and now in times of real crisis there is no signal from govt to use these funds for stepping up the efforts to fight the pandemic what do you people think about it
2020-04-07 20:48:50
that amount was lost by the govt when they gave income tax relief to corporates
it was meant for an emergency situation like today
there are temples that hoards billions of dollars with gold such as tirupati and trivandrum in one master stroke all those temples can be nationalised and can transfer the gold to government this will help to borrow more money from foreign central banks by placing them as mortgage remember chandrasekhar govt pledged mt of gold for forex reserves

it depends on where which city you want to buy i think the housing prices will fall further now because of recession everywhere so if you get a good deal then only buy now otherwise i think wait for some time but do your own research before making any decision
i am actually thinking of buying a house now my job is as secure as it could be and a small ish house in my city when rates are down and interested rates are down is a tempting offer
interest rate came down there were no demand at all real estate industry is in the bottom and no one knows when will it bottom out with no free floating money left with ordinary folks only bjp politicians have all the free floating money no one else you have a better choice to buy homes in india now if you are especially in us the rs forex value is very attractive per dollar so better buy now

here s my side of the story as a small businessman
this is going to be long i would really appreciate it if you can read this fully thank you for your attention in advance i m not sure what to flair this post as i m on a throwaway account that i may or may not continue using and i just want to share my side of the story while i sit here in loneliness watching random videos on youtube just to get my mind off of things and with no sign of sleep at all about me my partners i m a late guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the indian startup ecosystem to start my business i m also a college dropout by choice so i do nt have a graduate degree but i really loved the business we were running me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and i feel responsible for them one of them quit his safe cushy job when i messaged him at in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine i m extremely lucky to have these people in my life and i acknowledge that our business what we do our business is nt one of those apps or tech related business we re more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy think of it in a way that i m sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites i loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a fullfledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients how has the lockdown affected my business being a new business we were almost breakeven most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business we had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries reason why i said almost breakeven and i was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members remember we re all in our late we had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work this worked smoothly with some hitches of course in january when i read about the first case in india i was scared things got bad real soon around the world with every passing day i was worried more and more about what i was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown i checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown but the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach the main part of this whole thing was shipping which i had taken so much pain to setup one thing i learned while doing all this is that there s a reason why india with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry is nt able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand it s because the vendors are lazy even if you promise to pay them above the market rate make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials they are not willing to work for it and i m not talking about overtime or anything just their normal work cycle they are not serious about it at all i had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them we had this second vendor who just was nt serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work within a month i was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit i could nt change my vendor because that s a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which i could nt do in my volumes which were high i wrote all this because when my city got the first few cases i started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible we were given assurances promises we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now i have an inventory of products that is ready to go but i can not send them due to the state borders being closed my shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of india i m now in a sea of uncertainty where i have to pay my bills pay my office rent pay salaries with whatever i have in the business account right now the finances i m not even worried about the money i m worried about the inventory i have i m worried about the payment disputes i need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside india for every payment dispute i lose i lose extra the money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for the money for the raw materials are to be paid and i m refunding customers everyday losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that i might have earned what do i mean exactly now i m all for life money but as a small businessman who has been thinking living breathing his business all the time for months and years i m going insane i m having panic attacks i do nt know what i will do next i used to have a plan for everything now i do nt i m not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now my head hurts all the time i sleep for a few hours and when i wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they re burning i m also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than i am but that in my own opinion should nt be a comfort for me i m not sadistic i have no savings my company is running out of money there are people who need to be paid employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily he s a kind soul and has nt said a single word for it yet but i feel responsible and i m not able to calm down anxiety is on its peak for me right now and i have no plans to save us from this i come to this sub daily and i actively participate in discussions and disses but i have nt seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story i m scared guys i m not even religious and can just hope that the govt probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation i m wishing you all good health and please stay inside i m going to try and sleep now thank you for reading this
2020-04-07 10:59:46
i do hope you have a force majure clause in your fulfillment policy this would protect you from any fall out as things are nt in your control this is a unique situation where no one has control over anything whether they are an employer or employee also working with indian clients can be a pain in the arse as like you said they do nt pay enough attention to work inefficiencies are high there are leaks within the workflow process the system is far from decent let alone perfect i feel it is a cultural thing more than anything else from one small bujiness man to another let the dust settle you can not do anything now since nothing is in your control talk to your vendors and customers make sure there are sufficient open communication channels to ensure that they know your position and you know theirs this would immensely help you to get back on your feet quicker once you re aware of the issues you ll have to deal with once things open up you also have a lot of free time since there s no activity work on yourself and your company now look inwards take assessment of your processes see where you can improve workflow focus on efficiency with not much happening in the world this is an excellent time to introspect since we would nt get time otherwise when things are busy without disrupting operations i would also use this time to contact vendors who are of the same wavelength as you you re only as good as your team if you re taking the extra step with your vendor to ensure your operations are nt affected you re more likely helping him and not yourself it is nt your job to make sure he does his so that you get what you re paying for use this free time to search and assess vendors who take their commitments seriously as much as you do make some phone calls talk to people and get a feel of their product orservices you can also use this time to negotiate and do some ground level work this would iron out all the problems you re facing with your current vendors once the lock down is over feel free to dm i love to talk to fellow businessmen
i do nt have any advice that would help you i just wan na say be strong this too shall pass

for anyone needing to know about the number of tests performed each day check out here the icmr data which is released each day is updated to this repository

2020-04-07 18:56:49
the data gives out only the number of samples tested not the the number of individuals tested a person who has been infected will be tested again and again with a hr gap period until they are tested negative eg kaniha kapoor so the number of samples reported would not give a clearer picture of how many individuals were tested the icmr was reporting the number of individuals too for sometime until they stopped doing it if anyone of you have access to that please provide the links

will coronavirus lockdown cause food shortages in india

2020-04-07 18:35:05
in karnataka tonnes of grapes have found their way to compost pits amounting to hundreds of crores of rupees next week the harvest season will begin for india s most staple wheat crop in all probability shortage of hands for harvesting wheat could lead to rotting of the crop in the fields in france acute shortage of seasonal labour to harvest crops has prompted the government call unemployed to help farmers in the us the virus has sent farm workers half of whom are undocumented migrant labourers uncovered by trillion stimulus into panic the government has so far given a welfare relief of only rs lakh crore which is just about of gdp and that too largely for formal sector workers the informal sector which constitutes about of the country s workforce is yet to get any relief according to nobel laureate esther duflo any delay by the government in reaching out to them with cash or food grains could force them to defy the lockdown norms that could be difficult even for the police to control this will be not just india but for global as well
i think not india has enough food stored as buffer that they are rotting

idea for pmcares and chief minister s fund after lockdown ask for donation to fund instead of bribes
most of the central and state governments are struggling to generate revenue after lockdown and many of us will be glad to donate some governments are thinking of salary cuts eg karnataka cm warns salary cut for govt employees how about channelizing potential bribes to official funds for instance i have an inquiry pending with the local revenue department and have hired a lawyer to represent me he said he will negotiate a fee with the officials to have the case reviewed and approved rather than pay the fee or kickback to an official i will gladly donate double or more that amount to the pmcares or chief minister s covid fund would the government leaders be willing to open a channel for such quidproquo
2020-04-07 18:34:30
well this is indeed the case in some places where bureaucrats are all given certain fund raising targets for government schemes have donated to girls education funds by the government instead of cash bribes
they ll never do that bribes are their real salaries it what allows even employees with rs salary to send their children abroad bribes are ultimately funneled to the top and then a big cut is given to the mpmlacorporator or whichever politician heads that department modu ji has the courage to demonitise the nation s earnings but not to demonitise his brethrens earnings

i have worked in marketing before and the short answer is it s hard to find stock images of indians whereas you can easily find stock images for other races doing almost anything the only solution for us then is to either try to fit the stock image into the context or do a photoshoot which is at least times more expensive than using a stock image

you can abort with month pills next time use protection
go to any pharmacy and buy a pregnancy testing kit will cost you around bucks i will be able to tell you if she is pregnant or not is yes call into any hospital and ask for an gyno appointment i remember there are ways of doing a abortion via operation and medicines medicines leaves residue so might cause problems in the future
some times major stressful events corona virus lockdown deaths and overall negative environment do affect the periods so there s a chance of she not being pregnant but the best option would be to have her do a pregnancy test on her own

in addition to revenue there were also huge losses incurred by the need to ramp up and then down thermal power stations generated power since this exercise requires many tonnes of steam being released into the air other major direct costs came from deploying almost the entire staff of the power sector on duty possibly contravening the lockdown s physical distancing requirements there were some people here wondering how turning off lights en masse wastes power one of them even called someone who suggested this possibility a moron hope this helps

on losing hope and daydreaming about ceasing my existence
i am year old guy who happens to be gay i came out to my parents two years ago i repent that i didn t do it any sooner that s a different story related to internalised homophobia and bearing extreme shame inside i used to constantly contemplate taking myself off this earth not that i still don t think about it my parents are hoping that i might come around and say yes to the indian societal acceptance of marriage i am honestly exhausted putting up with my mum we argue sometimes but more than that i feel massive guilt have i taken their happiness from them have i caused shame to my family for what i am what if people start asking questions when my brother is getting married and me being the elder one is still unmarried should i just give up on life where i could be myself and just submit to them and spend my life in a loveless and sexless marriage all these questions have been haunting me for the last ten years i never had any friend that i could trust to tell them that i have been considering suicide for the past year or so that i have been exhausted of living with myself and the world around me that doesn t help i have all of these thoughts inside that are eating me up alive and i feel that hell is inside me i feel so alone and dejected in life all i have ever done in these twenty years is to suck it up all in and never show my vulnerability all my life i adapted to not feel anything and do everything like i have been told i get high everyday to drown the sorrow that nobody loves me i have never had a boyfriend or felt the butterflies honestly i thought i could move out of the country but that option is looking bleak i don t have enough money saved for the move and the depression is getting stronger that i am losing the will to do anything to achieve my dream there is inherently something wrong with me and i can t put my finger on it travelling is all i wanted to do but all i can think of is how fucking ugly i am with absolutely no skills to boast for like being a useless log that lies in bed all day if this is all there is i would rather pull the trigger soon after i make enough money to support my parents after i am gone i have nothing to look forward to life s a drag and i don t want to continue the chain of bringing more lives into this ruthless world sorry for the long rant i don t have enough avenues to vent out i am so sorry existence is a searing pain i want to get done i feel fucking awful
2020-04-07 11:45:30
as a year old closeted gay indian dude all i can say is i relate so fucking much at this point suicide is a fantasy for me that i think about when i m depressed and it actually makes me feel better a form of escapism i guess but recently i think i should stop thinking about suicide it not an option with old parents who did nt invest in any sort of retirement plan if my parents were not in the picture i would ve killed myself long ago as for coming out of the closet i ve decided that i m never going to do it i m sure most of my friends wo nt take it well and my parents are so conservative that i wo nt even consider outing myself to them lol marriage is no no it s not about me it s about not ruining another person s life just because i was dealt a bad deck of cards my plan right now is to become as financially independent as possible and distract myself with entertainment till i die or when my parents die in which case i can happily kill myself but ughh what i would nt give for a boyfriend who i can hug and cuddle and fall asleep with when i come back home from work
you should seek professional help soon
hey listen to me it will get better no matter how bleak it looks now i know it because at your age i also felt suicidal because i was gay depressed and did not know where to go my family was pressuring me to get married by parading a list of lovely ladies the only difference is that i could move abroad in time i fell in love got married to a wonderful guy and now ten years later the past feels like a nightmare that is fading away each day love yourself and you will survive this and flourish dm me if you want to chat

it s not a study just a blog the first part calculating cases as on march is a conservative estimate and it looks sound second part assuming a lag of days to infect family members is not something i ve heard of before but considering who says people can infect weeks post recovery the day lock down is indeed not going to be enough

i honestly believe that sleep deprivation is the biggest ignoredneglected root cause of health dangers that prematurely kill adults ask me sometime about the role of sleep in the leptin ghrelin cycle and how its interruption destabilizes weight homeostasis or about the new research showing that heart disease is not caused by fat like we thought for years but by inflammation in the circulatory system whose root cause is unknown but one of the prime suspects is you guessed it sleep deprivation but nobody wants to hear that lack of sleep is killing people employers don t want to hear it and god knows that having sold their waking hours to capitalism to survive workers don t want to lose the only time they have left to them to live their lives mostly stolen from sleep reminder humans are not meant to sleep for extended periods of uninterrupted sleep by this i don t mean humans shouldn t have hours of sleep a night i mean that we are supposed to sleep for four to five hours ish then get up and do something relaxing like reading for a half hour to an hour then get another bout of four to five hours this is what our bodies were designed for sleeping the whole night through was a fad started with the advent of the lightbulb sleeping the whole night through is so recent and artificial that first sleep and second sleep are mentioned in dickens novels lack of sleep for even a single night severely compromises your immune system if you re planning on getting little sleep or pulling an allnighter make sure to eat lots of fruit and veggiestake vitamins that day or even better get yourself some bee propolis it s a natural remedy used for thousands of years in latin america and is insanely good for boosting up compromised immune systems if you get the drop kind put to drops in a spoonful of honey and mix well with a spoon to mask the strong taste it has no side effects and is all but impossible to overdose on according to several government bodies around the world chronic lack of sleep is literally tied for place as the worst kind of torture the other is solitary isolation expecting a teen to get up for classes is the equivalent of expecting an adult to be at work at am after babies teens are the age group that needs the most amount of sleep puberty is exhausting and the body needs time to recharge ideally a teen should be getting between to hours of sleep at the bare minimum most teens are lucky if they manage to get and that s a gigantic problem not only does lack of sleep affect mood which is extra significant when your hormones are already riding a rollercoaster to begin with but also has massive effects on growth which is kinda what the whole puberty thing is supposed to be about according to research starting work before am is tantamount to torture and is making staff sick and stressed humans were not designed to have the same sleep cycle across the species much the opposite in fact night owls and morning people are an actual thing because we re pack creatures nature came up with a clever way for our ancestors to always have someone on the lookout for predators and threats make people naturally alert at varying times so that there s always someone alert to keep watch forcing night owls to follow morning people s sleep cycle means night owls live with what researchers have referred to as permanent jetlag adults need less sleep means adults need hours and teens need not adults need and teens need picked from somewhere else

american wondering how to tactfully refuse food
so i live in america and work in the home of a family from india i tutor their child since schools have cancelled for the year in my state they have increased my hours meaning that i am around for lunchtime now and they have absolutely insisted on feeding me this is very nice of them and all of the food they have made me is delicious but they give me so much i ll tell them that i m full but then they ll bring me another portion and i feel like i must eat it because it would be rude to refuse is there a way to tactfully tell them when i ve had enough food the last thing i want to do is disrespect their generosity
2020-04-07 07:49:25
welcome to indian kitchens this is universal and the only way out of this is to insist you are full when you have a lil bit of space left this way you can eat their final serving and continue to flatten your curve as well so to speak edit do bring in a dessert sometime return the favour
indian families generally insist on serving more food until you insist you are full it s a cultural thing in older days people were shy to ask more food being guests this was understood by the host the hosts hence tend to feed them more assuming the guest is shy these days people are generally very forthcoming especially in american culture i observe that people are honest and absolute with what they want and how much they want but sometimes being hosts they err on the side of caution to ensure the guest is satisfied just insist that you are full politely and say you have reached your capacity they will usually understand another thing to do is hold your palm facing the ground over the plate to block the food and just insist more telling you are full this gesture is an accepted gesture in various gatherings thank them for the food and appreciate the cooking so that they know you are satisfied hope this helps
oh boy i have some good tips for you eat slow when you are done quickly put the bits that have fallen through the edges back into the plate so the plate becomes unservable just get up and wash your hands when done no eye contact tried and tested in the field ps all techniques tested on my wife s family where i face the same issue

prime minister hints at calibrated exit from lockdown

2020-04-07 07:33:04
this is a doubleedged sword if the lockdown continues for more than weeks people will start to die of starvation and a greater issue of maintaining law and order will be created since you ca nt enforce people to sit at home and not feed themselves however if the lockdown is removed the rate of transmission will go up exponentially so the only way out is a staggered release of the lockdown those who are able to sit and work from home should be made to do so those who have to go out have to be done in batches so as to reduce chances of transmission and enforce social distancing rules strictly
the government should provide work from home opportunities to the people to help the economy and for those who prefer to go outside and work they can contribute to essential areas like farming crop production harvesting and logistics or assist doctors in healthcare people are just wasting time idling at home when they can contribute to the economy of course people can misuse this to get passespermits to go out of home hence it s essential that it s properly implemented
but is it really possible would we be in a better position after the lockdown than we were in the starting of lockdown the number of cases are increasing not sure how we are going to remove the lockdown

what happened to the crore rbi injected into the economy last year where did it go
i m no expert and i m asking this question out of curiosity and concern the money was taken out reserves kept for war time emergencies not sure about this now we are in a real health emergency does rbi have enough funds to balance the losses caused by this crisis the government is trying to generate funds through many methods pm cares mp salary cut world bank loan etc how long can we go on like this are we going to run out of cash with no major production and export how are we going to make money to feed the poor and daily wage workers are we in for collapse like greece or are we going to be okay i know at this time saving lives is paramount but even for that we need cash right
2020-04-07 07:32:08
those were to meet the deficit they re used or sitting to be used
i think that was used to fund a cut in corporate taxes in the hope that it would get industry to invest the saved taxes and employ more people i dont think it went that way as industries opted to either store cash buy back shares or just sit on it what our finmin didnt understand that this was a demand crash and not a production related cash so it s gone it s possible that nirmala sitharaman doesnt need economics just like she doesnt use onions
the money was taken out reserves kept for war time emergencies no surplus was passed on to the govt as is always done the surplus was much larger than normal this year so there was much media attention but the rbi still maintains its buffer reserves do nt speculate before you read about what was actually done are we going to run out of cash i do nt think you understand what the rbi does it s not responsible for importing goods its buffer exists to stabilize the rupee exchange rate

why is it called pmcares fund
this might be pretty obvious but i ca nt understand why it s called pmcares fund instead of indiacares fund am i missing something here it s clearly the indians that are doing most of the work instead of pmdid modi donated allmost of the funds i genuinely want to know please answer seriously
2020-04-07 06:06:57
because pm is the main stakeholder
pm wants to slap his mugshot on any and everything how many pages have his face in a single news paper multiply that by the thousands of publications across india he needs people to know that he s the pm of the country and the guy in charge because he s got very little to show for it in real terms so propaganda is his only alternative that and shit like banging thaalis and lighting diya
that s like asking why it s called pmnrf instead of indiannrf it s a semantics argument similarly states have cm funds now was the cares acronym chosen to swing opinions maybe probably that s debatable but with the legislative redtape around pmnrf there was a justified need for creating a different fund with the tradition of modibashing on this sub people are going to assume the worst about the intentions and usage of pmcares so you might want to account for biases here ps before i get my inbox bombarded with people calling me a bhakt i would like to state that i m not a bjp supporter and the op wanted a genuine response

a different argument on the grandiose gestures of our honorable pm
i have different view about the whole argument that modi relies on showmanship and bhakts always go a step further to show their love all arguments are based on the point where modi is to blame and where the blame lies on the stupidity of people the main villain of this whole act is lurking shadows the one that drives modi to do these magnanimous gestures and the bhakts going a step further the villain is social media and its cheapimmediate validation of people s acts modi is a wave on the ocean of time the one who is using the potential of this villain to the maximum who can stop the next person to emulate or even elevate modi s acts this villain has encroached upon every aspect of human life be it parents filming children in their age of innocence for validation teenagers risking themselves for a thumbs up adults taking stands that they might not believe in real life and everytime this villain shows it s magic the real issues take a background why even this post is a form of that villain where validation received by internet strangers will give a high of temporary happiness and a false sense of achievement the villain is here to stay how we let it dictate us depends on our choices

is nt it just fucking great how companies like ola valued at around usd billion desperately needs donations from people like us to pay their drivers wages amounting to
and i know that a lot of upper management in the company has donated total amounting to it still does nt make any sense that the larger part of the fund had to be crowdfunded when the company could take care of the whole amount and more while barely taking a hit retaining your employees in times of crisis is the responsibility of the employer and ola is more than equipped to deal with such a situation this means what they are doing is simultaneously putting the pressure on their customers to pay their employees salary while acting like caring charitable employers and do nt even talk about the ceo forgoing an entire year of his salary when you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country this gesture looks a lot more like what it actually is cheap pr bullshit and let s not forget after forgoing his salary for a year his net worth remains at around crore tldr fuck you ola we got bills to pay too pay your employees yourselves you cheap bastards
2020-04-07 05:21:57
an expert but valuations and actual cash flow are completely different items ola burns a lot of money in customer acquisition and is not a profit making entity yet gesture for driver relief is much appreciated they are not obliged to pay the drivers the drivers earn on a commission basis the demand they are already doing the bit they can i also saw a series of articles on how they are working with the govt for waivers on auto loans for their driver community let s not take the pitch fork each time and be grateful atleast will not choose to comment on the salary piece i personally think it s a good gesture note that his net worth is also including ola shares which are valuable only if the company does well which he is working very hard towards made some punctuation changes
this post sounds like you just want to get on the anticapitalism bandwagon and i say all this without bias i m no fan of ola i would nt take their rides even if they offered me free service ola had lakh drivers as of even if it were to give everyone just rs as a onetime gesture that s crores i guess most would agree you need at the very least rs to get thru this period that s crores so whether they donate or cr it does nt matter if you were ola management you d want to start crowdfunding as soon as possible because you re going to run short i d appreciate that sort of foresight to assist drivers instead of bashing such moves do nt forget that they are ultimately a lossmaking entity losing more than crores every year they re not raising vc money to channel it all to charity and like other comments have mentioned they do nt even have adequate cash in the first place valuation cash in hand do you want them to fuck over all their corporate employees to pay drivers why ola s top management has already taken salary cuts with the ceo letting go of his entire annual salary yeah you could argue it s no biggie as he s still filthy rich but so what what more do you want them to do and why in the first place so why is this surprising are you new to capitalism also when you earn enough in a year to feed a small impoverished country u wot

even otherwise you should be money is pretty much the dirtiest thing you can touch
for paper money the best solution may simply be to wash your hands with soap well after handling money remember soapy water physically dismantles the virus if you have a large amount of cash a reasonable assumption is the virus can be detected on inorganic surfaces after days but isn t viable so simply keep your cash in isolation for days and wash your hands after touching it

pmcares fund is plain fraud at a time of national crisis
pm cares is such a cheap trick at a time of crisis if the funds were donated to each hospital directly they would have already acquired ppe required to combat the virus instead the hospital in the country safdarjung hospital delhi is itself asking for donations of ppe the doctors of the top most hospital in the country itself dont have enough ppe how are other doctors supposed to fight this the bastard modi has collected thousands of crores from almost all major donors and none of the money is going to things that are actually required ppe increasing doc count health facilities etc this one is the biggest jhoomla of the jhoomlebaazi s career so far to distract people from his scam he is running bang plates diya ramayan etc just so that people have other controversial topics to discuss i hope someone is brave enough to approach the supreme court about this but seeing the way court has also been corrupted i dont think we stand any chance shame on you modi you mass murderer
2020-04-07 03:23:07
we will ask tadipar s cooperative bank to manage pmcares fund they did great job at the time of demonetisation
stripping away the emotion from the op the opacity of this fund is something to worry about even diehard bhakts can not argue against that heck from their point of view having full transparency is the best weapon they have if everything is changa in that fund then kaka is indeed a hero what is the best available resource for information on the collections and disbursements of this fund anyone i am unable to find anything meaningful

chances of government colleges opening after lockdown
i ve heard the national government say that they wont extend the lockdown but i ve also heard from other sources that it will be extended what is likely to happen for college students
2020-04-07 03:21:42
even if the lockdown is immediately lifted on april there is little chance that colleges will be opened immediately if they are opened there will be a lot of movement of students and being together in colleges and hostels which is nt good this is just my cents above that what this government will do sirf bhagwan jaane

so looks like we re going to be stuck in india for the next few months because of this coronavirus thing my wife and i both work remotely and would like to chill in some nice hill station literally our work depends entirely on internet connectivity and power so would any of you guys have a recommendation about which hill station has the best infrastructureleast power cuts and solid internet i also play a lot of video games at the same time my wife is working so a reliable and fast internet connection is even more important also we do nt cook and order out everyday so that facility is important too

legit question how are you going to go to that hillstation amid the lockdown
the most developed hill station would be shimla it has a few major businesses plus major cab food delivery services are operational there you will also be able to get fast reliable internet connectivity there but water is a major issue in shimla very major issue other hill station with all your requirements fulfilled donno probably sikkim or darjeeling though have nt been there in the last years but they should have good internet and food delivery services

these corona virus events are not the best way to judge modi s popularity hear me out
i have seen a lot of commentary online about how these taali banging and candlelight events show modi s unparalleled popularity and what it means for the future of our democracy while it is true modi is an extremely popular politician i don t think these events are the best way to measure it here is why to begin with most national leaders see a spike in their popularity when the country is facing a crisis this is commonly known as rally round the flag effect for example trump even after his colossal mismanagement in dealing with the corona virus outbreak has seen an increase in his approval ratings sadly this makes the pandemic a good opportunity for populists and fascists to seize more power and that should worry us for autocrats and others coronavirus is a chance to grab even more power only a small percentage of people understand the semipolitical nature of these events for most people these were nonpolitical events to fight corona virus many people who might vote for other parties also took part in these events for a variety of reasons including and not limited to love for the country rally round the flag effect peer pressure manufactured consent through media boredom etc these events happened at a time when the entire country is under lockdown something like this probably would nt be as successful as it was if there was no lockdown people are locked in the house and glued to the tvs modi govt used this situation to communicate and seek support for his events by nonstop media coverage it didn t matter which news channel you watched in the last few weeks you couldn t escape the marketing for these events dozens of popular film stars sportspersons religious leaders etc were deployed to spread awareness and seek support for these nonpolitical events i doubt many of these celebrities will openly lend their support for modi s other openly political projects like caa or nrc many news channels also portrayed the act of lighting the lamps as a prayer to the god to help fight the virus given how religious this country is and the situation we are in the message was naturally persuasive for many people this is what really forced some in my family to light the lamps not the message of solidarity or politics a few news outlets packaged yesterday s event primarily as a prayer more than anything else and that worked opposition whatever little is left couldn t openly oppose these events the either unenthusiastically supported them or just kept quiet that won t necessarily be the case under normal circumstances it is my assessment that the devastating effects of the pandemic on the economy will have infinitely more impact on modi s political future then these marketing events a lot of potential political damage to modi on this would also depend on the performance of congress as an opposition and that s a sign of worry given the state of the grand old party modi s popularity is a byproduct of a compromised media ecosystem these pr stunts by modi and the communalization of the outbreak proved that once again so in my view it s the death of independent media that should worry us more than modi s popularity as the latter stems from the former sadly i don t see a solution for the media problem anytime soon on the bright side modi s popularity doesn t automatically translate into victories in state elections for the party we have seen that in the recent assembly elections where bjp lost despite major political events like the dilution of the article and the ram mandir verdict to conclude no lok sabha election results were not announced yesterday
2020-04-07 01:41:36
i agree most part but death of independent media was because of modi sending income tax notices and withdrawal of revenue generating ads from govt communalisation of this pandemic is due to government intentionally turning a blind eye to such reporting what tablisi gang did is unforgiving but the communalisation of the same ca nt be justified it cell and troll targeting anyone asking genuine question from govt is ignored or appreciated but fake news from whatsapp university is promoted ministry of ayush promoting bs that ayurveda is only way or treating of prince charles lack of ppe kits and masks or lack of testing questions are yet unanswered by the government ppe kits and masks being diverted to politicians and administration instead of doctors eg check fb profile of collector indore and compare the same to doctors of indore collector saab is wearing ppe suit and masks but doctors are using raincoats yet people rallying behind government is concerning and this virus is here to stay for a few years lok sabha elections is just years away this popularity of government is concerning

men who are and have decided not to get married what is your plan for old age
the corona virus has given me some time to think about my life choices a bit i am male and have decided not to get married its not my thing but i will be honest i am worried about old age not so much about loneliness but about sickness weakness inability to look after myself financial support i can still plan for this in india i think people still rely on their children to take care of them in their sunset years i will take care of my parents until their last day but i sometime wonder what will happen to me any body who have decided not to get married and have figured out their plans for old age

plan your finances work and enjoy in your own ways when you are healthy go see the world then move to an assisted living apartments when you are retired from working do nt wait to become a cabbage to move to such living make friends there and plan for becoming a cabbage phase of life there
am and unmarried i think my only fear is medical emergencies rest all can be managed
i think you are missing the point of marriage it s less to do with spousalchildren support as you grow old and more to do with going through life with fulfilling relationships as a year old let me say that raising my daughter was about the most elevating and fulfilling experiences i have had in my life it has completed me she is now doing her own thing in another country and i certainly don t expect her to come and stay and look after me when i am old and infirm and i can not but keep thanking her for being born as my daughter my wife is my age and we have now started the journey of looking after one another when she was ill i stayed by her side and when i suffered a heart attack recently she stayed by mine and we keep fussing over each other it s called growing old together but yes i did plan financially for my older years and those plans have more or less come to fruition but that s just a bonus the main part of my life and marriage has been the fulfilling relationships although i will admit the journey was fraught with severe issues and problems but when you put everything on a scale i would gladly go through all this again and again so don t look at marriage as a prop for your old age that s silly look at it as a journey of fulfilment of relationships and going through the joys the trials and the tribulations of parenthood

centre places restrictions on media in covid press briefings shifts focus to tablighi jamaat

2020-04-07 02:24:59
the main learning from the jamaat experience for publichealth experts is that if they were to test other clusters they will find similar high incidences in many places the communal virus has over taken coronavirus they should take all such clusters this seriously and look for more clusters by testing all symptomatic cases as well as all admissions and deaths due to sari acute respiratory infections sundaram added at this point people belonging to any community other than the tablighi jamaat should be concerned that they are not getting the medical attention they need the measures are not in keeping with public health practices
as is evident the court specifically refrained from passing any strict orders curtailing the freedom of press and simply urged the media to be responsible in its reporting at no point did the court recommend that the press conference should be limited to fewer journalists or that important questions should not be asked of the government yet the central government appears to have interpreted the court s to justify even lesser transparency since april the centre imposed strict restrictions on the journalists allowed to attend the briefings and ask questions of the government officials since then most health reporters are no longer permitted to ask the government about its actions and strategies many reporters frustrated by the islamophobic dogwhistling and compelled by an effective media gag have taken to social media to raise the questions that the government has evaded

a hospital in us has requested to people for making these masks and dropping at their place please check it s called olson mask

an undergraduate degree at cmu might set you back by at least over years that s almost crores if you take the exchange rate to be which it will reach soon you might get a chance to work in the us or apply for a mastersphd there if you can afford the fees that might be a good option but remember that the average pay would be close to in hand gross which means that the payback will run into a decade unless you manage to increase your salary substantially also you never know what the visa situation will be like cs at an nit is also a good option much cheaper and has a lot of brand recognition call me biased but the best professionals i have interacted with have studied at an iit especially the older ones kharagpur delhi mumbai kanpur and guwahati i m not an iitan so do nt make troll posts stating that i m being elitist i have done a phd from a top university abroad and even here if you have a degree from an iit it really makes the bored professor smile in appreciation the advantage of an iit is that it has the best peer group you can get at your age and these are the folks who usually get the top spots at graduate programs abroad you may not get computer science but you can try getting a minor in the subject and seek a job that s into any field of applied engineering a lot of people will tell you that iits are hyped and low in ranking etc please understand that rankings are based on research output the number of international students and professors etc they are not based on student quality or jobs they get after graduation rich universities game the system while those in developing countries like india suffer all in all it is a good dilemma to have personally i find it risky to spend crores on an undergraduate degree if you want to go to the us or eu or some other country get a masters or a phd from there after doing your ug from here
cmu hands down great school you ll have a great experience however the program is intense so just fyi ps i got into bit after then dropped out after semesters gave my sat and went off to michigan

a small rant
i love how people can play the game of simon says banging utensils lighting diyas and who knows what next and assume that they have done their part and feel satisfied the fact that they can attribute terms like solidarity unity improving morale and paying homage to the medical personnel is nothing more than spitting in the wound so i ve seen a lot of people calling doctors as gods heroes and saviours right now assume yourself in the shoes of a doctor you are now working in a hospital where there s a shortage of ppe s masks etc you are walking with inadequate protection among s of sick people who might potentially be infected everyday you re working hour shifts barely getting any rest all while an uncertainty looms in the back of your head if you are even going to get through this pandemic alive then you see all these people doing all kinds of weird shit and cheering you on to walk in to that death trap again how would you feel if your idea of being a hero is to sacrifice themselves then never call them that see them as humans humans just like you and me humans with families goals and aspirations humans with a desire to live to see another day if anything heroes like them are meant to be protected so that they can do their jobs not sacrificed lighting diyas because you are bored of this lockdown hell yeah banging utensils because you wanted to have some fun hell yeah but dont you dare mock the people battling in the frontlines by justifying your shenanigans with meaningless words that fit your narrative if you really have that uncontrollable itch to do something about this situation either use your social media to demand for more testing more protection gears for the hospitals or stay the fuck home

i m an mbbs intern working in a government hospital in a state where the government has implemented esma act on doctors and healthcare workers now i m in this profession only because of my parents wishes and have no actual passion for this i hate this job and now i feel insecure because of lack of safety equipment we are sent into containment zones with surgical masks i m already anemic and i want to quit but there is a consensus among my colleagues that i could be jailed for quitting my internship at this point i know nothing about this esma act and i m extremely worried if i stop attending my duties i could be warned that i wo nt get my degree but i do nt want one not in this government where the life of healthcare workers is a joke and is considered nothing but expendable can anyone please give me any advice on what i should do and the consequences i could face

since you are not a doctor yet there wo nt be many consequences you can take leave and join internship again after this is over but the state council will ask all sorts of questions at the time of registration also since interns are the grassroot workers there will be more pressure on your fellow intern and staff which will be detrimental to them and you in future best advice right now is create your own ppe be very vey cautious

are we hypocrite inherently
okay so i see myself amidst a society where people live a double life one life is the personal one and the other they think they and everyone around is supposed to live but the fact that they do nt live it and are ignorant of it i ll give you some examples of it in between these quarantimes we see people on social media arguing about who is wrong and who is right for every step that govt takes and therefore they split people into two groups national and antinational instead of thinking about the notion of a simple idea like torching lights they fight over and make jokes about the people who wo nt do it and to the extent of bullying them they act as if they care so much about the nation that they wo nt let that person become antinationalist change his thinking and be a help for the country mind it it s all happening on the social media but in the reallife you ll see the same set of people breaking the rules throwing away garbage here and there when asked about justifying their these acts lead to a kya fark padta hai attitude do they do this just because they want to show other people i am a student at a premier institute most of my classmates live a double life when it comes to academics when there is an argument over why our education system is not productive each and everyone will start suggesting how the institute does nt provide excellent teaching and profs are boring etc but when it comes to them they wo nt give any second thought about playing games in the class bunking them even indulge in cheating almost every time if they are left unattended on the one hand people pretend that they have very profound knowledge about who is wrong and what is to be done for the betterment of society but when it comes to them they themselves are the very first one to break the rules

nah it s just the trials of living in the modern age where you are expected to respect but are not respected in turn i do nt know about the whole social media stuff as i can only see antimodi posts on my twitte etc but as for your college your classmates are being reactive to the input they re receiving we ve all seen videos of amazing professors who give interesting in depth lectures at foreign institues then we re told oh this college is world class they can compete with any college in the world and a lot of our professors seem like they would nt have the chance to be a janitor at those foreign institutes apart from publishing useless industry research papers at a blistering pace and the courses are either outdated or insufficient to grant mastery of the subject matter bunking classes who gives a shit dude only in india is attendance seen as major issue on par with grades if a young adult has better things to do than attend some bogus lecture that is just reading slides in front of a class then as long as their grades stay up does it matter is having my butt in the seat going to improve my knowledge somehow i used to just sit in the last bench and learn the subject matter on my own personally pes university bangalore since attendance was mandatory but the professors were garbage edit also hell fucking yeah i cheated whenever possible being eligible for top tier job interviews at job fair at time of graduation was given on the basis of fucking grades i got my gpa by hook or by crook
we want everyone else to be perfect but do nt like to be pointed that we are nt perfect we are critical when it comes to others behaviours but went it comes to us there is concession we give to ourselves it s everywhere in everyone of us my professor once told me we all have biases we will always have them but it is important that we are aware about them so that we can take necessary measures accordingly that s probably the one of the biggest take aways from my yrs mba

see if you can get permission from local police station over phone record the call or some way to arrange an emergency pass for a health emergency that way your ass is covered in case neighbours become pesky or you are asymptomatic carrier who ends up creating a covid cluster in the clinic you go to
go stomach issues are no to be taken lightly esp with your situation inform the doc what time you re coming carry a hand sanitizer dont touch your phone until you sanitize dont touch anything and wear a mask if u have one sanitize before and after exiting the hospital dunk your clothes in a bucket with detergent for a day if cops stop tell its emergency and you can talk to the doc

open letter from kamal haasan to prime minister narendra modi

2020-04-06 20:27:34
full letter for those who have been hit by paywall to the honourable prime minister republic of india respected sir i pen this letter as a responsible but dismayed citizen of our country in my first letter to you dated march i had urged the government to not lose sight of the plight of the unsung heroes of our society the most downtrodden the weak and the dependent the very next day the nation heard the announcement of a strict and immediate lockdown almost demonetisation style i was taken aback but i chose to trust you my elected leader the one we would like to believe knows best i had chosen to trust you even when you announced demonetisation but time proved i was wrong time proved you too were wrong sir firstly let me assure you that you are still the nation s chosen leader and bn indians including yours truly will follow every direction of yours during this crisis today there is probably no other world leader who has such a mass following you speak they follow today the country has risen to the occasion and invested its trust in your office you must have noticed that even your naysayers clapped and cheered when you gave the call to do so in order to appreciate the countless healthworkers working selflessly and tirelessly for the masses we will comply to your wishes and orders but our compliance must not be confused as our subjugation my own role as a leader of my people entails me to speak my mind and question your ways please pardon my lack of etiquette if any my biggest fear is that the same mistake of demonetisation is being repeated albeit at a much bigger scale while demonetisation led to loss of savings and livelihood of the poorest this illplanned lockdown is leading us to a fatal combination of loss of both life and livelihood the poor have nobody to look upto except you sir on one hand you are asking the more privileged people to put up a spectacle of lights while on the other hand the poor man s plight is itself becoming a shameful spectacle while your world lit up oil diyas in their balconies the poor are struggling to gather enough oil to bake their next roti your last two addresses to the nation had you trying to calm the people which is necessary in these trying times but there is something more urgent as well as important than that these psychotherapy techniques can address the first world anxiety problems of the haves who have a balcony to cheer but what about those who don t even have a roof on their heads i am sure you don t want to be a balcony government only for the balcony people by completely ignoring the poor who are biggest constituent of our society our support system and the foundation on which the middleclass the welltodo and the rich build their lives the poor man never makes it to the front page news but his contribution to nation building both in spirit and in gdp can not be ignored he has a majority stake in the nation history has proven that any efforts to destroy the bottom has led to the toppling of the top even science will agree here this is the first crisis the first epidemic that the top of the society has inflicted upon the bottom and the topmost ie you sir seem interested in bailing out everybody but those at the bottom as millions of daily wage labourers househelps streetcart vendors autorickshaw taxi drivers and helpless migrant workers struggle to see light at the end of the tunnel we seem to be securing only an already wellbuilt middleclass fortress don t get me wrong sir i am not suggesting we ignore the middleclass or any one segment in fact i am suggesting the exact opposite i would like to see you doing more to secure everybody s fortress and ensure that nobody goes to bed hungry will continue to find more victims but we are creating a fertile playground for hunger h exhaustion e and deprivation d of the poor hed is a malady that is smaller in profile but far deadlier compared to s impact will be felt long after has vanished every time there is a feeling that we have a chance to arrest the slide you seem to be sliding into your comfort zone of unleashing a spirited electionstyle campaign idea it seems you are comfortable outsourcing responsible behaviour to the common people and transparency to the state governments this is the perception you are creating especially amongst those who spend enough time working toward and intellectualising for a great today and tomorrow for india i am sorry if i have offended you with the use of the word intellectual here for i know that you and your government does not like that word but i am a follower of periyar and gandhi and i know they were intellectuals first it s the intellect that guides one into choosing a path of righteousness equality and prosperity for all the focus on merely keeping people s spirits alive through warm and fuzzy campaigning is probably leading your establishment into ignoring certain actionables that could actually save lives long into the epidemic when the entire country s law and order system had been primed your system failed to stop congregations of ignorant and foolish people in different parts of the country these have become the biggest hubs for the spread of the epidemic in india who is responsible for all the lives lost due to this negligence as per the chinese government s official statement to the who the first confirmed case was reported on december even if you concede the fact that the world took a lot of time to understand the gravity of the situation by early february the entire world knew that this is going to wreak havoc of an unprecedented kind india s first case was reported on of january we had seen what happened to italy yet we did not learn our lessons early enough when we eventually woke out of our slumber you ordered an entire nation of bn people to shut down within hours a mere hour notice period for the people when you had a month notice period visionary leaders are ones who work on solutions long before problems become big i am sorry to say that sir this time your vision failed furthermore your government and its appointees seem to be expending all their energies on a combative response to any feedback or constructive criticism sane wellwishing voices with national interests in mind get quickly intentionally and clinically drowned by the trolls of your army and are dubbed antinational i dare anyone to call me an antinational this time the common populace can not be blamed for being illprepared for a crisis of this magnitude but you can be and shall be blamed for this the government is appointed and paid by the people to keep their lives normal and safe events of these magnitude get etched in history for two reasons one being the devastation illness and death that they cause due to their core nature the second being the long term impact of what they teach humans to prioritise and the kind of sociocultural changes they bring about i am extremely saddened to see our society plagued by an outbreak that is far more dangerous and longer lasting that any virus that nature has ever hurled at us sir this is the time to listen to voices who truly care i do care it s the time to smudge all boundaries and give a clarion call to everyone to come on to your side and help india s biggest potential is its human potential and we have tided over bigger crises in the past we will overcome this too but it must be done in a way that brings everyone together and doesn t become yet another reason to choose sides we are angry but we are still on your side jai hind kamal haasan president makkal needhi maiam i recommend reading the whole letter he raises very well and thoughtful points he raises all the questions what any sane and a patriotic indian should ask or no doubt thinks but can not ask because of the very thing he already says in his letter the fear of being drowned out by the screaming of brainwashed cultists

one vaccine is to stop subscribing to cable television and subscribing to play on demand streaming services once you read consume news on mobilelaptop by your convenience you will realize news channels are bloated and unnecessary
very true hatred in heart is a more deadly virus than corona and it causes more burning and pain not only to the victim but the ones around him too any wrong step taken by the government can actually cause greater damage than the virus itself excessive lockdown and stoppage of economic activities can cause famine religious propaganda can cause riots disputes all overhyped religious news in media should be banned temporarily to create a harmony

pune woman s death due to puzzles authorities

2020-04-06 20:23:28
same thing had happened in japan either our testing methods are not too reliable like serologic test or we do nt have enough data to understand this virus
lesser viral load is the key word some tests will come as negative in low viral load conditions doctors let go the people pathogen will keep doing its work this concern was expressed by icmr director initially for the same reason bulk testing is not the answer as the test itself is not very reliable in some conditions may be we should assume every one is infected and adjust our lifestyle to reflect the same edit in china italy and other countries due to the limitations of trained people process and technology the numbers balooned the current lifestyle contributed heavily to the spread if tools fail us only defense would be changing our lifestyle

resident doctors association at safdarjung hospital in delhi has put a plea for donations of ppe kits masks and hand sanitizers

2020-04-06 20:14:13
what do you even say at this point this is one of the best government hospitals of the capital and they have to beg for basic things to fight this pandemic and we are nowhere near the peak of positive cases and deaths source mods do nt remove this post vidya krishnan is among the few journalists consistently putting out great reporting on this issue and trying to hold the government accountable
what is the pmcares fund doing
the biggest problem is no one is questioning the government about their responsibility whenever there is a question about their responsibility they start with a new propaganda and the sad part is people even gets indulged in that i mean why if this situation become dire there will be another propaganda and their is no end to this why is this country not understanding its own benifit

i m not sure if this has already been shared here as the post is almost weeks old but this shows what was the preparedness level two days before janata curfew and how authorities messed up at the igi airport which probably have lead to local transmission of there itself
original post by vikram sharma on fb insider s account triage facility at igi delhi airport hello i landed in india on march at hours at igia indira gandhi international airport terminal new delhi india just a few hours before the ban on international flights ordered by the government of india came into being i am exprime minister s fellow rd and through this post i am sharing my firsthand experience about arrival testing facility and everything in between for whatever that s worth i hope my account will help you get a glimpse of what s really happening on ground and how much are we really prepared as a country to deal with the pandemic i have divided this post into short sections as per the four stages of testing process followed at igi delhi as i understood it kindly note that i did not hear any government official or medicalsecurity staff using these terms for different testing stages i have used them for organising my thoughts stage alpha arrivals immigrations i arrived via ethiopian airlines flight at am on march as i entered the airport building i saw the first screening checkpoint with doctors waiting for us since i was the first in the queue a lady doctor moved a handheld device in front of my forehead and took my body temperature i then handed over my prefilled medical form to her which the airline staff gave us before landing her fellow doctor asked me which country i came from i answered ethiopia he looked puzzled and had no clue where the country was and that s fine he was a doctor not a quizmaster so i did nt expect him to know so i told him it is in east africa surprisingly this being the very first screening point he did not have a checklist of highrisk countries iran italyspainchinaetc so that he could check and categorise me as a highrisk or a lowrisk passenger the lady doctor recommended him to call one of the senior doctors at testing facility and get further instructions on how to categorise passengers arriving from ethiopia he did not have his mobile with him so he asked the lady doctor to call she did not have talktime balance to make a call what they did next left me shell shocked male doctor said arre phone nahi mil raha toh choddo jaane do sabko if we ca nt connect to sr doctors leave it let everyone go and my medical form was stamped quarantined at home without asking about my travel history or medical condition most of the passengers behind me got the same stamping on their medical forms and we were directed to the immigrations at immigrations counter roughly passengers from early morning flights were either sitting on the floor or swarmed around the counters some with masks some without them these were passengers who came from all over the world with travel history that apparently included visits to dubai iran italy china japan south africa spain russia the us etc i call this stage so at apparently infected and uninfected people were made to sit together at less than arm s length from each other in a partially closed hall without segregation by country medical history or age masked people sat with unmasked one young people sat next to old people pregnant women sat next to unmasked women taking maternity tips midage uncles shook hands over political gossips teenage kids sneezed without tissues and got back to their smartphones and many coughed out in that same open space and these people were made to sit in front of immigrations counter for hours before moving them to the next stage refer photograph stage beta postimmigration post immigrations we joined a group of another people who had cleared immigrations before us and were waiting to move to the next stage so we became a larger group of people at this stage we were randomly divided into smaller groups of people i call this stage at which people with all sorts of travel and medical history and widely different demographic characters were segregated into smaller groups of people and were taken to the next hall since people in each group were randomly selected out of this was the second level of mixing that was done my group of had five passengers two indians who came from serbia and a couple who came from melbourne those groups of each were given numbers from to and then made to sit next to each other at less than an arm s length for another hours in the same hall refer photograph stage gamma pretesting now it was time to move to the next stage in the process a team of a senior bureaucrat a medical supervisor and a policesecurity supervisor began calling three groups at a time and instructed all people to stand in a queue at less than arm s distance from each other some wearing masks some without masks some coughing some sneezing some even eating a banana or a cupcake those randomly mixed groups of each were taken to the baggage belts sequentially one after the other luggage was already unloaded by airlines staff off the conveyor belts so it was literally a sea of baggage pieces lying all over the place from belt to belt as passengers began collecting their respective luggage each touched at least different baggage pieces before heshe could identify hisher own and some had their gloves on while majority did not and some had sneezed or coughed into their bare hands earlier once everyone collected their luggage each group was assigned a police officer whose sole responsibility was to take hisher group of to the testing facility setup outside the igi next to the ube pickup point by now it was pm and my group was waiting for its turn to be called at the testing facility note that since my arrival at am to the time when i claimed my baggage around pm it was already hours without food rest or sleep and till this point no official testing or consultation with a doctor took place however passengers infected and uninfected were randomly mixed in smaller and bigger groups at least three times by then refer photograph stage charlie ok tested testing finally at hours since i landed and checked in at the airport my group was called to the testing facility along with two other groups we all walked in with our luggage as i entered i read on the sign board triage facility the facility had two rooms one waiting room as you entered and one testing room beside it with an exit from the facility so at a time members of one group went into the testing room with their luggage while those of other two groups waited in the first room when i entered the testing room along with members of my group i saw doctors in their quarantine clothing wrapped headtotoe in white suits head caps and transparent eyegears by now we all expected doctors to ask questions about our travel history our recent medical condition and run some sort of blood and nasal swab tests right well we were all wrong as i sat in front of my doctor she handed over a pamphlet it had symptoms explained in hindi and english on either side of it she then asked me to read it and ask any questions or doubt i had though i did not see any medical devices syringes or nasal swab kits anywhere in the testing room i was still hoping that may be the doctors would do it on case to case basis postconsultation my doctor asked me do you have any corona virus symptoms i answered with a no expecting a few more probing questions about my health history recent condition etc to my utter shock she picked up a rubber stamp and stamped me with a proud to protect delhiites home quarantined till april below are some of the questions and the only questions that my group members were asked before they were stamped home quarantined without any blood swab or other tests did you take a bath today do you take bath every day are you on any kind of medication do you smoke i left the triage facility around pm roughly hours after i landed in the morning many of my group members took connecting flights to ranchi cochin bangalore mumbai lucknow etc refer photograph in a nutshell this is what happened in those hours as per the plan which was put in place around people were checkedin at the airport without segregation as per their travel or medical history those people were grouped three to four times into batches of different sizes and demographic composition same people were repeatedly made to sit with each other in the same space in close proximity for long hours finally most of those people after apparently infecting each other in the last hours were stamped home quarantined at a triage facility without running any medical tests all cleared patients left the testing facility and would have mingled with the larger population in different parts of india on their way to their homes this all happened while the rest of india was implementing junta curfew and bollywood celebrities were clapping or banging thalis from their balconies while nris were gloating with pride over india s stupendous success at keeping spread under control while uncles were explaining how government s step will help break the chain while aunties were experimenting with turmeric and neempatta recipes to cure corona virus and while the media were busy running talk shows instead of reporting on the most vulnerable entry and exit points in the country our airports special thanks i am grateful to the frontline health workers doctors airport ground staff cisf and police personnel and all the volunteers who discharged their duty selflessly putting themselves at a great risk every single day to help passengers complete the screening and testing process endtoend i have nothing but huge respect and loads of love for them they were just following orders ps by the time i left the airport it was already pm and given the corona virus situation in delhi i did not want to put my friends at risk so i chose to stay in a hotel for a night and then leave for home next morning i booked a room at lemon tree hotels red fox hotel delhi airport hotel asset aerocity hospitality district igiairport for a night through a friend and reached there by pm the ground staff checkedin my luggage through security scan as i walked in towards reception the lady there took my passport as id and asked for my travel history i told her that i flew from ethiopia and have been checked by doctors at igi airport for my symptoms and none existed she asked me for a medical certificate so i showed her the stamp on my hand from the triage facility she seemed indecisive and requested that their home doctor would do my checkup i readily agreed and waited for a few minutes soon the hotel manager prateek shukla not fully sure about his name intervened and told me that they ca nt take me in i reminded him about delhi government s order that gave people selfquarantine option at private hotels i also mentioned the notice on their website see photograph that had no such information about denying entry into the hotel based on suspicion in fact the notice s language seemed inclusive and empathetic despite all my efforts to reason with the manager i was denied entry into the hotel that i had prebooked by now it was pm i asked the hotel transport staff to take me to any other hotel in aerocity but was told that all hotels have internally adopted the same policy and no one would let me in given the junta curfew my options were few if any i took a call to pick the first bus i would get and leave for home i reached home at am today after hours of mental torture at igi hours of arguing with some hotel staff to let me in and hours of road journey feeling scared helpless and angry

growing up in india as a chinese person is hard you grow up in a society where you do nt really belong and you re subjected to racism your entire life in most cases it s negative racism and that really could affect your upbringing you generally grow up in a world of distrust to others that said there are positive racism that go in your favour but those are rare and far in between and then there are those few people in your life who you grow up with who will remain by your side your entire life that s nice all that said and done i sincerely wish that there was more exposure to races and cultures in the curriculum of schools

the union government delayed framing proper guidelines and standards for the manufacture of personal protective equipment ppe meant for health workers and first responders treating coronavirus patients in india the delay is one of the reasons that health workers in india are now facing a severe shortage in high quality protective suits the convenor of the preventive wear manufacturers association of india sanjeev ralhan told huffpost india in an interview in this interview ralhan who has been manufacturing surgical gowns and drapes since explains that his association sought the government s directions and guidelines on the manufacture of ppe meant for health workers treating coronavirus patients as early as the first week of february only to be met with silence the buffoons you elected to power are directly responsible for this shitshow the doctors nurses and other hospital staff will die because of their criminal negligence these nazis you elected to power were busy orchestrating a pogrom in delhi a mega show for the orange man and toppling a government in mp while the spread and no preparation was being done

two weeks ago there was an attack on a gurudwara and atleast sikhs were killed islamic state claims attack on sikh worshippers in kabul gurdwara death toll rises to gunmen and suicide bombers stormed a sikh gurdwara in the heart of afghanistan s capital of kabul on wednesday killing at least worshippers and wounding as many in one of the deadliest attacks on the minority community in the country according to a media report one of the attacker was from kerala he had joined isis
i think sikhs is a small amount for the indian govt to evacuate only planes the only problem is that they would need to be tested and quarantined
bring them back asap if they think india is where they will be safe then we should evacuate them immediately sikhs is a positive addition to our society

man posts no ventilators in ludhiana on facebook booked for sedition

2020-04-06 18:47:51
in its official fir briefing ludhiana police said that the man had been booked because he created panic tried to mislead administration during lockdown and attempted to create a feeling of hate among common people towards the government
it s hard to believe that there are no ventilators in ludhiana not sufficient is another thing but the following text sounds suspicious i hope he is not trying to con the public by asking them to donate to an ngo the asi added that the post also asked people to donate money for a particular ngo which was planning to buy ventilators for coronavirus patients the post further had some phone numbers for people to contact to donate money to the ngo
apparently there is a shortage of ventilators at least that s what tribune reported few days back

kudos to everyone for making my family feel very safe in these times
i m a muslim residing outside of india i spoke to my parents today and it broke my heart while everyone took part in whatever happened at pm yesterday my family took part in it entirely out of fear fear of being singled out if any of the lights in our house were switched on even by mistake my mom switched off all the lights minutes before pm and double checked it if she had nt left anything on even by mistake call this paranoia or whatever my family does nt deserve this and we live in one of the most safest neighborhoods in mumbai so kudos the islamaphobia has paid off my family feels unsafe in its own home
2020-04-06 18:13:11
well my parents are hindus and even they switched off the lights out of fear of bhakt neighbours as well but yeah i understand this islamaphobia is only going to get worse the longer bjp stays in power
yeah we re muslims too and had to switch off all the lights because our colony went dark and people came out with diyas and started staring at our house
this is not just muslims anyone who does nt abide by what pm modi has said is looked down by his followers it s the same when a radicalized muslim look down upon a free and liberal muslim for example my friend who goes to jamaat look down upon all of us for not following religious instructions he does nt play holi and argues with those muslims who plays saying it s against islam and why do nt they adhere to preachings by their religious leaders it has been everywhere in our society every section of our society suffers from it and lighting diyas is nothing but an act of symbolism that s it and people who believe that this will cure virus are fools and my request is stop worrying about them these are the times to stand together casesday now and we do nt know how many more are not tested yet

pune doctors in quarantine after tablighi jamaat meet attendee tests positive

had the patient s family disclosed his travel history atleast the staff would had taken precautions now almost the whole hospital staff is blocked for two weeks other patients will suffer due to this as well as they may have gotten infected as well a hospital official said we had asked him and his family members about his recent travel history but they said he had none a team of doctors assisted by nurses performed an emergency surgery involving resection of a part of his damaged intestine when the patient developed fever two days later the hospital staff became suspicious and questioned his mother she then revealed that he had attended the tablighi jamaat congregation in new delhi we sent his throat swab sample on friday and it turned positive for on saturday night the official said in addition to the surgeons and resident doctors about other hospital employees including nurses attendants and cleaning staff who were exposed to the patient have also been quarantined their samples have also been sent for testing
these people who lied about their medicaltravel history to doctors should be denied any medical help should be thrown in a jail cell to rot there so they do nt spread it more and let their immune system decide whether they live or die you ve not only put your life at risk you ve literally spread the diseases to different parts of india and now have quarantined an entire hospital staff which could be saving lives you are the scummiest of scum out there
if people are going to be this stupid we will need to do mass surveillance like china record all mobile numbers spotted by cell towers near the jamaat meet and follow up and quarantine the corresponding users

no ppes were given to nurses what do you expect
it is unfortunate that such a big cluster of cases have come from a medical facility they should have taken precautions said suresh kakani the additional municipal commissioner with what candles plates the united nurses association said they were not tested or removed from shifts till symptoms emerged and were not given ppes despite attending to suspected patients the hospital has however denied the charges of course

anyone else in the group who is not in india and is freaking about their family back home
just the title i am currently working outside india and shit has never felt so real as it s feeling right now i haven t been directly affected by the pandemic yet barring the minuscule inconveniences but i am worried sick about everyone back home my parents are old and not in the best of health the thought that something might happen to them and i will not be able to even get there is just so unnerving what s even more unnerving is the fact that folks who are practically an hour away from their parents will not be able to get to them either sigh what a world stay strong folks
2020-04-06 17:42:10
the way i am helping them out is by planning told them not to believe anything the bjp govt says virus is serious if you go out wear mask wash your hands and have a bath once you are home this was in february then even before the janta curfew i urged them to get enough grocery to last a month when lockdown was implemented they did nt have to go out to get any food did ask them to stock medicine but there was insulin that was missed and had to get them after lockdown recently they went shopping for food i asked them instead of going to local store go to supermarket and get stuff for atleast weeks so that you do nt need to go out of the house i think one needs to plan ahead to be safe i am concerned about them hence asking them to be extra careful
well they can survive this if they stay healthy and maintain their health corona wo nt get to them easily but economic impacts can affect them also if they happen to get any other medical conditionemergency now hospitals will be crowded please ask them to eat stuff that improves immunity like vitamic c magnesium iodine cut down on junk food especially processed sugar which reduces magnesium in body also moderate exercise can be useful
yes i m worried for my parents it also does nt help that they are both over my mom has asthma and dad has diabetes i ca nt do anything other than ask them to follow proper hygiene and stay at home my mom has very good hygiene standards which she has amped up even more during these times my dad did not take it quite as seriously until last week but he is listening to my mother now i just hope he continues doing so despite all of this if they fall sick it is true that we can not be there for them and that worries me too this is unrelated to the topic but does anyone know if there is any delivery service in india that delivers groceries on the same day or at least within a couple of days my parents still go out to get groceries because they say there s no delivery service for that

scientific temper vs faith
the following is an excerpt from a article on how to do research at the mit ai lab link to the full article given at the end of this post the following excerpt is about how to read a research paper read with a question in mind how can i use this does this really do what the author claims what if the above is what scientific temper is all about it gives us the option of questioning everyone and everything this has been drilled into me and other researchers by our respective research advisers to never accept anything until you can prove it to yourself until you can convince yourself of the validity of the idea presented in a research paper no matter how successfulpopular the author of the paper is no matter how well cited a paper is do nt trust the presented results until you can prove it to yourself either by deriving the proof yourself or by writing the code doing the experiments and reproducing the results yourself a scientific temper teaches you to question everyone from your parents then your teachers to your governments the reason this is not easy is because it requires you to have an ego big enough to say everything is wrong until i verify it and simultaneously a humility big enough to say i was wrong when a mistake is pointed out in the political scenario you have governments and followers indulging in fearmongering to keep people in tow you see fake videos spreading hatred and phobia that are easily debunked you see governments telling you that there are terror elements that intend to destroy the country while a simple database lookup will show that on average annually less than people die from crossborder terrorism of all kinds in india option is to blindly believe anything your government says option is to put a lot of effort into investigating it yourself option is about having faith akin to following a religion its about clapping and lighting candles while having blind faith that everything will be alright no questions asked its about mindlessly chanting all is well as portrayed in that ironically idiotic movie this option leads to a faith based governance do nothing have faith in us option is about seeking the truth for yourself by exploration and collecting your own data samples its about being constantly updated and asking rather nagging them with questions like when will a mass testing program begin this option leads to peopledriven governance where we hold the decisionmaking power at every step of the way and the government only holds tools to execute those decisions more power to you me everyone how to do research http lampcfarumded

every human is born with a curious mind sadly the curiosity is killed in the early years of a child by religious indoctrination children need to hear i do nt know maybe we can learn together or maybe you will discove it in future sadly people have too much ego to say i do nt know until people learn the importance of skepticism billions of children will be robbed of the opportunity of becoming adults capable of progressing our civilization edit exceptions as always edit makes me sad when my family asks me not to think much they sure miss the joy of being a curious and a skeptic human
could nt have put it better myself that is if i could
a great post one more thing i want to add is that as a researcher we are supposed to ask hard accurate questions and only later try to solve it if we do nt ask the right questions we can never hope to get the right results no matter how big the question and no matter how hard it might seem we are still supposed to ask it however what i am personally seeing around is that whenever i doubt our current system and ask uncomfortable questions about it the immediate reply is so what s the solution and i may not have a solution then it immediately turns me into person who is always critical i believe this is a big problem if we continue this way we ll never get to the answer as the questions are not being asked and we ll always be stuck with current problems

rant i want to become the benjamin in this animal farm that india has become
observing the current political scenario of the country i feel helpless the left and right both have forgotten their purpose of social welfare one is ready to jump off a cliff because a certain person told them to whereas the other would also jump off the cliff just because he asked not to i do nt think i can do anything to improve my country my fellow citizens and my life so i want to become like the donkey benjamin from animal farm he does nt give a fuck whatever happens as long as he gets food and a place to sleep sure there will be days when the food is scarce and the roof leaks but again there will be days when there is plenty of food and luxury hopefully because i feel helpless and unable to do anything so i want to become indifferent to this shit one would argue it s a recipe for depression but depression can be eased with medicines i doubt there is a medicine for helplessness
2020-04-06 17:01:23
i ve been indifferent to this shit since around there are days when you ll confuse this indifference with cowardice or unpatriotism but trust me its better than anything else currently shut your senses and pretend to go on with your life
yes your approach is right ring master has this basic strategy of asking doing stupid thing he never tells in detail how is he going to do or the precautions for it which ought to be criticized and many people do he waits till everyone gives their perspectives and the situation becomes a heated debate then he quickly implements the changes so as to make the situation appear not so bad precisely to the point which his followers predict now his followers are proven right because he exactly fulfills their aspirations the faith of the followers is fulfilled and their trust on him reaffirmed he never accepts his mistakes nor can anyone question him that which could bring his lack of planning to light in the end the follower is proven right and the critics wrong even though their apprehensions were real enough to be answered in the first place a lot of energy is wasted in trying to explain the drawbacks which will fall to deaf ears being indifferent solves the problem as long as we get our basic needs apart from some bad days our lives will keep going with less mental stress
if you are ready to get on with your life it is time to prepare plan b make ready money passport and travel kit the cost to relocate will be high but with careful planning there could be workarounds research research research before you leave find organisations and contacts that are in the area you want to go to this is not going to be simple but you can escape this mess if you are determined trying to process the confusion in india is just a waste of time instead focus on finding a way out of this chaos it is a big world and once you leave india you really will know how wonderful life can be do nt give up

however the current lockdown is likely to be extended beyond april in hotspots like mumbai noida bengaluru etc

every state in india has something unique to offer from the backwaters of kerala to the hills of arunachal pradesh the forts and palaces of rajasthan to the sunderbans in kolkata it s just not possible to recommend a few places to visit my advice would be to look up each state and figure out what it has to offer and chalk up a travel plan also as a comment suggested it would nt be a bad idea to take a train ride to witness the beautiful countryside stay safe and happy travelling

citizens should stop addressing the pm s theatrics and just come up with their own activites as an act of defiance
i do nt know what exactly the pm wants to accomplish with these people pleasing acts but the one thing which is clear to some of the people is that this is far from what should be done by the government and the citizens those of us who feel this way should just stop participating in or even addressing these theatrics and as a bonus plan and execute our own small scale activities activities which will keep the sheeple indoors out of trouble and prevent them from spreading misinformation or anything the fact that much of the country does nt give a damn about what the pm or any other influential person or celebrity says should be enough to shut them up and make them focus solely on the pandemic they do nt know what it s like to see our neighbours relatives and friends do dangerously stupid things during a crisis they wo nt have to deal with the fallout the media wo nt stop addressing this shit the celebrities will keep spreading nonsensical things and other bad things will continue to happen i think what we as responsible and sane citizens should do is this just follow the who and govt guidelines regarding safety and health stop addressing anything the govt the celebrities or any influencers say that does nt focus on facts or logical steps regarding the situation do nt address any gestures or encouraging words from them come up with fun activities to engage yourselves and your neighbours to save them from participating in mindless behaviour even if small pockets of our population do this instead of submitting to whatever our leaders push on us it ll be a victory when we look back on this period of crisis i do nt want to see these influencers labelled as heroes and saviours i do nt want to see the glorification and rationalisation of these dumb acts i want to see the stories of frontline soldiers and those few citizens who refused to be led into idiotic acts who defied the system who went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the survival our their community and their sanity our leaders do nt represent us we are smart and sophisticated history should remember how the citizens were the ones who kept the nation alive and kicking i guess what i m basically saying is fuck modi fuck celebrities fuck those irresponsible assholes who have willingly and in full awareness of their actions ensured the deaths of thousands do nt pay attention to anything else just stay safe stay home and do your own thing

r e l a x decisions made in such haste are often regretful later on you have witnessed mass stupidity yes but do not judge the entire character of the country by this there are numerous of our kind who opposeddid not conform to these silly social experiments and they re the voice of reason try to have more such people in life and you ll feel relevant and heard and find your place in this world with that being said if you feel exclusively wronged somehow by india and indians and if it has caused you nothing but sorrow and regret do consider emigrating if you feel that is going to give you the relief i am not judging you all i m saying is that sometimes it s not the place it s the people you surround yourself with social circles can be revamped it takes some time but it s not impossible
just saying stupidity of human beings knows no country so wherever you go story is gon na be the same that aside i can totally understand what you feel you ve been let down by people and your friend social distancing can be wonderful sometimes just mute the toxicity and do something that makes you happy
this place used to be decent few months back but now it s all the edgy teens and their whatsapp screenshots if you want to emigrate this is the stupidest reason i have ever seen i hope you are in touch of world news to see if people like us exist in other places or not few days back some people lit multiple towers on fire in uk after a rumor has spread that causes coronavirus us the stupidity levels dwarfs india by much of the extent many eu countries people are still chilling outside in countries like sweden hungary passed a law to rule by decree if you want to get rid of stupidity then antarctica will be the ideal place emigration gives you a better quality of life and that should be your reason how old are you do you have a job or still in college

dude it s april dehradun is nt that cold
i think you should reach out to the local police and check what they have to say and how they can help but since she s at her son s place i think it s the best option she has got a secure place and people to take care of her as dehradun to bengaluru is not possible as of now
you ca nt bring her back without seriously putting her life in risk airlines are nt operating and so are nt the trains even if you do get the approvals to bring her back it has to be over the road either through an ambulance or some other vehicle this is not safe for old person your better option would be to make arrangements for making the room she stays in warmer more blankets thermals room heater etc until she can wait this period out i suppose your uncle may have a family there so even in his absence the family can make some arrangements for this

ventilator numbers
india reportedly has ventilators for the entire country alot of them are nt really in working conditions btw ventilators for a population of crores and if we re to assume the best case scenario as of india tests positive for covid that s crores infected people considering worldwide numbers of reported cases are serious requiring ventilators so of crores is lakh people needing ventilators but we only ventilators rough times to come tl dr india is pretty fucked
2020-04-06 07:46:18
the number of ventilators only give half the picture in reality most hospitals will rarely have too many ventilators free at any given time in big government hospitals ventilators are almost always occupied just because we have an epidemic does nt mean other illnesses have stopped majority of our population ca nt afford the ventilators in private hospitals hopefully government manages that one of the biggest reasons behind trying to flatten the curve is to prevent our healthcare system from getting overwhelmed because that can lead to people dying from other diseases as well due to lack of critical care facilities
thanks i am honestly shocked at how passive and indifferent the response to issues like this seems to be even on reddit here the latest ice model which is probably the most respected in the world predicts that between of the entire population is already infected in european countries germany uk us all say they expect of their population to be eventually infected why on earth are nt we preparing for those kind of numbers especially with our healthcare and density issues we will need way more ventilators if we intend to do our best to save lives am not even sure about that though the death numbers can easily be masked under other comorbidities and the denominator actual cases will remain unknown anyway without the testing needed at scale decades from now the world could look back at this time in india and call it the biggest genocide by incompetence the modern world has seen that scares me

2020-04-06 07:24:44
i spoke to other epidemiologists and scientists at icmr a senior scientist who is coordinating the icmr s work on confirmed one basic and important detail off the record the numbers for total samples tested include repeated tests done holy fuck if it s true it means that the actual number of patients tested is incredibly lower than the current number shown
also there has been discrepancy in data released by states icmr and ministry of health and family welfare since initial days none of the data ever matches a volunteer driven data tracker has done much better job as of they report cases while mohfw website shows cases

how do i get my boyfriend s parents to give me a chance
i hate being a white girl barging in during a global pandemic to talk about my own shit but if anyone wants to get their mind off of it with some sweet inlaw drama read on so we screwed this up pretty badly my boyfriend is indianamerican his parents are south indian and arrived in the late they re pretty liberal and openminded nice people generally but he s their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he s dated anyone they ve given him an extremely hard time about it switch to me i m very in love with him we ve been together for years the first months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice no arguments it was amazing he met me because he was doing a term abroad we broke up when he left could nt stand being apart have spent most of our time together in an ldr he loves me too we mesh well together we have similar aspirations we support one another we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us incidentally i m canadian i m about to graduate from university once i do i want to live with him again the only way i can do that with my credentials is get married we do nt want a wedding or anything we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day switch to his parents because we live apart i only met them once on the pretense that i was his friend because we did nt think at that point we would stay together he has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering obviously they fucking lose it now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences financial costs we re too young etc all things i deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it but the thing that s plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that i m not the brahmin doctor they wanted the not being indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met his mom fucking cries about it his dad is like i m depressed from all of our financial problems and now you re doing this to hurt me every time he does something they do nt like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this what we should have done is told them about this from the beginning let them get to know me build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child but we did nt have that foresight because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young but now our commitment is clear and the cat s out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together i do nt expect them to ever accept me i want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear i do nt want their goddamn money but my boyfriendfiancee and i want to start building a life together immediately not however many years down the line they ll decide he s settled especially if he s settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname i just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible and preferably me too thinking about this call makes me nauseous they re just gon na tell me i m useless for however many minutes idk that anyone can give advice but i need to try so i have less of a chance of screwing things up thanks randia tl dr how to convince somewhat religious teluguamerican parents to go easy on their son for choosing a nonindian girl and at least give us a chance
2020-04-06 05:58:50
do not bother to convince them now just sign relevant agreements and marry your boyfriend after few years once you get a kid do hisher naming ceremony from your parent in law s house they will first accept your kid and then yourself
what a nice deviation from the usual gloom and doom but i think zealous indian parents may be as bad as the virus anyway there s nothing so far that you can do the onus is on your boyfriend indian parents for the most part in situations like this will eventually mellow out if the son takes a strict no nonsense attitude which is difficult for some indian men being so reliant on the parents as they are just be yourself do nt try to placate them too much they do nt have the right to give you a hard time just because you re not the bride they were expecting

india celebrating a new festival or it s just a distraction
as most of the indians are switching off their lights at on april we really need to ask the question is this a new festival is it required or it is just a new method of distracting people s attention from more severe question our government is a master in distracting people from the tel question is this the same as i see people celebrating this moment and not asking about the real question here why are we doing this i asked my family members and some friends they all said it s a mini diwali today lord ram killed the meghanath so we all are celebrating well that s funny isn t it in my personal opinion this moment is just used to distract people coz in recent to days the daily new cases are more than and reports are emerging from across the india that doctors don t have enough ppe they are not being treated well by the officials and the people they are treating some media houses is saying that government is not providing reliable data on the no of cases and the measures taken by them to tackle coronavirus also the reason behind the new fund pm cares is also not clear as the pm relief fund already has more than cr rupees and how government is using the money from pm cares these are just small questions which we really do need to ask from the government and they don t want to answer that so we really need to ask is that is this was really necessary or it s just a new propaganda by government to hide its tracks like previous many i m not saying this is bad or you shouldn t do it i m saying we really need to focus on the real problem which is coronavirus in this case celebrate and ask ps if you are commenting then please be gentle

i agree for most of it i dissent on gandhi could nt have done it quip gandhiji led people to walk after him to burn their expensive factory made clothes to fill the jails to die but not to pick weapon gandhiji was magnanimously welcomed in britain by the mill workers who were at loss due to his swadeshi movement when mahatma gandhi was welcomed by textile mill workers of lancashire and all of this while setting such high moral benchmarks all of this while there was no electronic media as we see today you could nt compare this charismatic dimwit or any other leader for that matter with gandhiji there s no comparison there
we re wired to follow not question it s a habit instilled from our school days
i was reading baudrillard s america yesterday and his description of reagan applies to modi too and it works with this smile reagan obtains a much wider consensus than any that could be achieved by a kennedy with mere reason or political intelligence the recourse to a pure form of compliment be it animal or infantile is much more successful and the whole american population comes together in this toothpaste effect no idea not even the nation s moral values in their entirety could ever have produced such a result reagan s credibility is exactly equal to his transparency and the nullity of his smile

rant some people need to be thrown into prison for spreading so much of venomous hatred and misinformation that fuels communal tensions
as you all know the delhi riots which happened a month back saw many deaths and it acts as a symbol of the divide in our country this divide will only further deepen if we allow the endless flow of misinformation and fake news through whatsapp and other social media sites with the coronavirus further slowing down an already relatively slow economy and increasing an already high unemployment rate such misinformation will definitely cause more riots or worse a civil war the ones who will be affected the most by this are the poor during the delhi riots most of the people who died and suffered were either poor or of the lower middle class and the ones who are suffering now due to the virus are also the poor they will only further suffer if such misinformation that causes communal tensions are spread to the people who have read this post till now if you see anybody in whatsapp or any other social media site posting any misinformation or fake news i implore you to call them out for spreading such misinformation and tell them that it is illegal and punishable if they further do so whether you are respectful to them or not is at your own discretion if they still do nt stop then report them to the concerned authority here s a link related to the law thank you for your time

are there no tolerant voices among devout hindus left anymore
i really do nt believe the hindutva brigade represents all hindus we know that most of the left leaning people are very tolerant of all religions and do nt have much prejudice but they also tend to not be very religious themselves whereas i m talking about believing hindus here from what i know most hindus have been highly tolerant and accepting people of all faiths and races historically why has hinduism been hijacked by hindutva now a lot of people generally just want to stick to their culture and principles which their religion patriotism gives them but they are being misled by the hindutva brigade that you need to be intolerant if you want to be a good hindu or a good patriot for that matter i remember earlier someone like kumar vishwas of aap used to criticize bjp citing hindu texts and accusing them is tarnishing the name of hinduism but unfortunately he jumped on the hindutva brigade too are there really no hindu leaders left who preach tolerance and brotherhood anymore
2020-04-06 04:08:55
no religion called hindu what we call hinduism is paganism in the subcontinent the preferred word is santana dharma pluralistic and inclusive most of the time prolly evolved to avoid conflicts since everyone and their friend has a god whatever you believe in or do nt you can make space for yourself in this religion atheists welcome ca nt get more tolerant than that muslim hatred and hindu nationalistic tendencies are just plain old xenophobia and the fear of the others old tribal tendencies devout hindus are pretty tolerant coz tbh they do nt know any other way
do devoutness and rationality go hand in hand

video in manchar maharashtra police beats up young guy in an inhuman manner who was just taking tiffin for his parents at the farm

2020-04-06 03:02:59
in other countries hitting on neck and head would have charged action against police officer provided that the person was not retaliating against officer it seems the use of that force was not warranted in this case this is hard reality of most of indian police i have personally been hit like this while just reporting police that my landlord s security cheque had bounced and when they refused to act telling them section against which this was illegal
video is from a verified and mainstream but regional newspaper maharashtra times more details gist of the article this incident is from gawadewadi manchar maharashtra the young guy was taking tiffin for his aged parents working at the farm the guy can be seen pleading for mercy and repeatedly saying sorry but the policeman did nt listen if hitting on the legs was nt enough the guy was hit on his head badly

get ready for a huge surge of muslimophobia and hindu nationalism afte this lockdown
i ll be straighforward our country already has a lot of muslimophobia i am not gon na say islamophobia because hating islam as in ideology should nt be treated as a bad thing treating muslims badly because you hate islam on the other hand should be bad and hindu nationalism is evidently on the rise even though at first thought it might seem that coronavirus may not affect the rate at which these two are growing it is going to affect it in a huge way the biggest blunder has to be the tablighi jamat out of cases cases more than of the cases has been linked to the jamat among the rest if you just see the initial list of dead people from corona you will see a lot of them if not most had visited saudi arabia or other muslim countries as you might know muslims are already blamed for almost every historic and bad events there is a huge chance that the entire coronavirus epidemic in india maybe said to be brought by muslims to harm hindus the number of fake news which tries to show that muslims are deliberately trying to harm hindus is already bad unfortunately for muslims during this crisis when they were already being alienated by caanrc jamat has been responsible for the steep rise in cases not that hindus or other religions did not do something like that hindus got together in vaishno devi they got together in many festivals they got together during gaumutra party they got together for thali bajaaing but there has been no cases linked to any of those events it might be that there are coronavirus carriers and cases among them but since it is nt testable and observable we can not make any definite statement it wo nt be scientific to make things worse if we somehow get through this nightmarish pandemic remember modi will get all the credit people will say that modi handled the pandemic in india well this might even increase his approval rate among common people not to mention that if the apparent growth rate of cases in india remains slower than other countries as it currently is it might increase people s faith in the superiority of india people might say look at those immoral westerners they have been punished for their immoral lifestyle by karma that is why india such a holy land has nt been greatly affected by it apart from those muslims and chinese who brought that disease to india this narrative might gain a lot of attention never underestimate the power of fake news ethnonationalism authoritarianism and racism

each time he ask the gullible do something like lighting lamps he makes them surrender their rationality makes them complicit in his act in fact making them own it this is standard cult recruitment trick whereby a recruiter induces you to do simple things for him to initiate you into the cult it helps that this is done when you are terrible stressed confused therefore more likely to surrender your rationality to the recruiter once you surrender your rationality in such a simple act you automatically become obligated to defend it which is why new recruits to cult are so fanatical about defending it by these simple tricks modi ji cultivates a cult that will do anything to defend him by now modi ji has a sizeable number of such gullible cultish followers who will do anything to defend from criticism from others no matter how justified such criticism may be creating a cult is more science than art and modi ji s methods are a text book case to follow

recruitment and sourcing in india need advise
so i recently joined a small consultancy as a recruiter this is my first job and i have no prior experience in hr just need some advise for how to go about sourcing more profiles and dealing with possible candidates more effectively what i ve learned in my recent time here is the basic looking up profiles by searching mass mailing job posting etc i have access to naukri and monster portals currently it mostly just involves dealing with passive candidates and only getting a few interested here and there via calling how can i make an effort to get more active candidates and more relevant ones also dealing with people in remote or rural areas where people do nt have good communication skills in english or even in hindi south india etc such areas also have a scarce amount of profiles on job portals or applicants what would be the ways to get profiles of interested job seekers in such areas the main issue is the setup daily profile targets which let me say i do nt have any problem with but the fact that others experienced people for some reason like to send irrelevant profiles or one that anyone will reject while i try for more quality profiles and am more interested in resolving the recruitment process without anyone having trouble and the whole thing being beneficial to the candidate i know what a pipe dream not the way thing works and what not also the fact that i am a fresher and am not efficient currently tl dr am a newb and need advise how to source more profiles more efficiently also recommend me references or articles about hr and related things so i can learn more thanks

it was evident that these grandioslydumb exercises had everything to do with creating a cult ritual and nothing to do with science and medicine in these trying times i would nt have minded had i seen baba ramdev or sri sri doing this but coming from the pm it s just a mockery of the authority my previous post here

amazonin is running this donation campaign where they are asking customers on their platform to donate to pmcares fund and other ngos like akshay patra oxfam etc which is a good thing however there is no option to pay via amazon wallet or cards or net banking one needs to signup to upi and set it up with amazon in order to donate through them i believe it is a cheap marketing strategy which should have been avoided at this moment many people like me who do not use upi because they simply do nt want another banking service are frustrated with push campaigns already and this donation thing just triggered me to the point where i felt the need to post about it here i quickly checked that paytm is also accepting donations for pmcares and they have no such strict rule to accepting money there are obviously other means but this kind of marketing tactics from amazon is unacceptable and needs to be highlighted source

that s really bad to know anyway i think we can directly transfer our donations to the fund of our choice pm cares or whatever ngo we want by going to their official websites we do nt need intermediaries like amazon or paytm

askindia are there any hikikomori in india are you one let s talk about this
hello the home isolation has caught up to me and i m wondering what it s like for people in india who have been reclusive and have been living at home for years and years is the phenomena of hikikomori different in india i know many in our country are unemployed where do such people live are they truly socially reclusive how do people make ends meet in such a dire situation how do they cope with the extreme social isolation and general disregard of a non contributor in a society what can people do to identify such behaviors what triggered it for you is there a way to curb such triggers if you do relate to this phenomenon please do nt shy away and open up about what you feel indians suffer a lot of developmental problems when growing up some people are high functioning despite their inherent problem which often snowballs into something big it s only a matter of time bullying and peer pressure play a huge role in our society and affects our personal decisions how do we mitigate all of this i d love to engage with you guys over here for now and have a better understanding of your expectations and needs to whoever that participates on this thread please be civil and respectful god knows how much people have already suffered
2020-04-05 22:27:48
the whole concept of hikikomori might be differently perceived in india than what is generally seen in japan india definitely have a fair share of recluse populace but i doubt the people who stay in isolation for such long time can survive in india most of the parents of hikikomoris in japan have come to accept the fact that their sondaughter is a shut in i ca nt even imagine our parents being like that especially when we as a country fail to stress the importance of mental health
been working for a few months now but i spent around years unemployed prior to it lived with parents still do they ve been supportive college was the trigger for me i had zero liking for the course and at the same time did nt really have any interest at all which i could pursue instead so i dragged myself through graduation because something was better than no qualification at all initially i went through that phase where i punished myself for being a useless loser who fell behind his peers but i never had any dreams or passions with regards to career and stuff so my neet status in itself gradually stopped being too bothersome an issue to handle but every once in a while when things went south i wished i had a bearable facade of a purpose to keep myself occupied during those times i ve been always been pretty bad at socialising once i went into the neet lifestyle and got completely acclimatised to it it worsened the matter i stopped keeping in touch with the few friends i had from school i felt as if we inhabited different worlds so there was nt much to converse about made a few friends online but the came and went i work now but it has nt affected my feelings about work and social life working hours a day days a week continues to he an outrageously ridiculous concept to me and i almost never desire to create new connections i ca nt guess what exactly would have made the difference for me because i remember myself being like this even in my oldest memories

we might have entered the exponential growth stage of infection in india that is characteristic of the spread of here s how
the number of cases in india has risen exponentially in the last few days going from cases daily to now cases daily total cases in the country as of today a week earlier there were cases seeing the growth trajectory of the confirmed cases country by country it can be seen that india is still on an upward trajectory and has not yet reached the peak one essential thing that shows the slowing down of infection in a country with other countries you can see they ve started to curve in the graph so the worst is still yet to come and we wo nt know how much the rate of infection has been until testing capacity is increased multifold the infection spread rate however have slowed because of the lockdown the country needs to be prepared with the worst that is yet to come with ppe ventilators and all other necessary equipment sources
2020-04-05 21:59:08
people act in such denial like there s absolutely no reason why india won t follow the same curve as other countries and if it doesn t it means we aren t testing enough peoplerecording enough deaths stop acting in denial and stay home
simple calculus exponential growth happens according to an elementary differential eqn that dictates increase in patients at any time is dependent on the absolute number of patients at that time it means that if there are more patients at a time the increase in patients at that time will be larger because more patients actually their counterparts who are not yet detected assumed to be large if admitted people are more have much pronounced effect on increase than a smaller pool exponential curve is just a solution to this differential eqn so to get a different solution exponetial decay or some decreasing function which is ultimately required you will have to change yhe differential eqn itself or in other words remove dependence of increase on the patients themselves this is why lockdown helps if someone is infected he can spread if lockdown is not imposed but can be averted if it is but hear me out this is important even after imposing nationwide lockdown this eqn appears it means it is not fulfilling its purpose it reflects inner loopholes and this is the reason why any lockdown will never work in this country reasons people are idiots they feel as if govt is against them its not govt releasing good news makes people play this virus very weak people feel themselves at a lesser risk because they see good news and will be willing to venture out when police isnt patrolling will never follow social distancing when shopping etc govt does not think before acting simple they are bunch of beta males who dont know what to do when doom strikes this is evident in every casualty we have had every indian who has died dies because it was transmitted to them from ones who came from outside and yet stupid govt let everybody in without strong checks its as if coronavirus itself beat govt

why has india reacted to declining global crude prices by raising excise duties

2020-04-05 21:46:38
to loot money
to gather revenue while the prices are low and make sure the deficit is not exasperated by the covid situation too much people do nt seem to realise that when economic activity is down government revenue is down everything from gst collected at computer shop to challan issued at a traffic signal india will soon have to devalue their currency to generate more cash

looking information about a caste or tribe changar
hello the changar tribe can be found in pakistan afghanistan central asia but they speak a language related to rajasthani marwari braj or haryanvi they must have migrated from north india to punjab and then to peshawar and afghanistan and beyond along the way other lowstatus communities joined with them some speaking punjabi but assimilated together for sociocultural regions according to wikipedia in india the changar are largely a landless community with a few still involved in their traditionally occupation of lime manufacture most are now daily wage labourers like other rajasthani muslims the community has a caste association or biradari panchayat which resolves intra community disputes and enforces communal norms although the changar live in close proximity to other such muslim castes such as the hiranbaz sindhisipahi and qaimkhani intermarriages between them and the changar are extremely rare the changar are sunni muslims and their customs are similar to other rajasthani muslims they have been granted other backward class status which makes them subject to a number of affirmative actions policies of the government of india this part i believe is true according to their traditions the changar left rajasthan with their initial settlement being in the districts of bikaner churu and nagaur from there the changars migrated to sindh a further migration then took place to punjab where many are still found they speak marwari among themselves and urdu with outsiders however it is dubious to claim that many of them migrated to persia in the sasanian empire from there to sasanian egypt to byzantine empire where there descendant s became known today as the romani people in turkey who live mainly in east thrace thanks and keep safe

people in tech would you choose noida or bangalore for a job
i am a native of uttar pradesh and have worked here in noida for more than a year there are a couple of things i like here namely the cheap economy cheap rent great housing in newly constructed apartments great infrastructure with water gas and electricity i m from a toptier engineering college and have a decent pay looking for a change in job around start of and colleagues recommended bangalore just because it has a lot more opportunities in the category i d be looking for and should be my choice above ncr some of them have already been there and mostly came here for their families and advice me so here s what i pay for in noida rent for bhk larger living area kms from office takes minutes to reach in rupee split among two people per side for uber electricity is cheap gas pipeline is way cheaper than cylinders used at homes what s the equivalent for bangalore drawbacks too few companies to apply for edit from toptier college i make around lac inr per month you if you re in blr what s your opinion on this
2020-04-05 21:00:07
stick to noida it s cheaper and you will be near your family you can save a lot
what are your priorities from what you ve mentioned it looks like lesser expenses bangalore is way more expensive to live
having lived and worked at both places bangalore any fucking day noida is cheaper noida might have family but the quality of work companies peer group etc bangalore beats the shit out of noida also less pollution far better weather conditions work environment cosmopolitan structure etc however if your family is near delhi noida stay here as you are going to save more and can look after them

you are privileged if you think that the lockdown is great for the environment
as much as i love lying in my bed and not hearing the sound of horns an extremely loud engine or the annoying tune of a car in reverse or looking at the sky and seeing blue or the night sky and seeing the stars fact is this makes me privileged talking about how we should have lockdowns intermittently for the sake of the environment is a privileged thought think of it this way when it s a sunday afternoon and there are heavy showers it cancels alot of your plans and it s an inconvenience but who does nt love looking at the rain right that same rain is probably destroying someone s chance to earn their daily wage or accumulating so much water their house may be destroyed sitting at home bored or missing your daily mundane life is a point of privilege and should be acknowledged by all of us

spoiler for parasite this exactly what happens in parasite the rich lady praises the rain for cleaning air while the same rain destroyed lives of the poor including her driver
there is nothing wrong with feeling privileged to enjoy the natural beauty someone else s poverty is not our fault there is a difference between normal rains and storms fucking up the environment is only going to produce worse storms it s also not our fault that people are breeding like rabbits also a clean environment is a privilege for everyone even the poor
yeah so what s wrong with feeling privileged over the clean environment i didn t choose which family i get to be born in even if i could i d have chosen a family with a good standard of living you would have too no one wants to be poor its just that some are dealt better cards at birth than others

delhi has not been given a single paisa from the crore allocated to states here s why
hi there as is being reported by the news approximately crore has been allocated by the centre to the states here is a representative news report centre grants rs to states to tackle coronavirus crisis times of india of this crore crore is the union s contribution to the state disaster response mitigation funds sdrmfs and the rest is as a revenue deficit grant tl dr the short answer on why delhi did nt see a single paisa of this money is because the fifteenth finance commission xvfc has not included delhi in its recommendations this is because delhi is not a state the finance commission a constitutional body deals with financial relations between the union government and state governments deep dive the xvfc recommended creation of a new disaster mitigation and response fund at union ndrmf and state levels sdrmfs these new funds are distinct from the og national disaster response fund ndrf and sdrfs under the disaster management act the ndrf and srdfs are for meeting expenses for emergency response relief and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster the ndrmf and sdrmf are for local level and communitybased interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentallyfriendly settlements and livelihood practices large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the union and state governments note the difference here lies in the words response ndrfsdrf and mitigation ndrmfsdrmf mitigation is predisaster mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters note the ndrmfsdrmf are statutory legal funds under the disaster management act just like the ndrf and sdrfs note the supreme court in in an act of judicial activism directed the creation of a national disaster mitigation fund ndmf and state sdmfs this was criticized a lot cause the court s got no business in the executive working this direction was not followed by most governments in india and has remained a nonstarter similarly the approximately crore of revenuedeficit grants are only for state governments source finance commission report pages and accessible here at the finance commission s website edit and update it seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments the union s devolution under the xvfc s recommendations is a constitutional obligation and was meant to happen regardless of the coronavirus epidemic it also seems that people are rightly so peeved at redtape because effectively the government of delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis some possible financing mechanisms that i ve elaborated in the comments section are further union contributions to delhi s sdrf most effective making funds available from the union home affairs ministry improbable given constrained budgets ways and means advances from rbi day credit limit union spending through new delhi municipal corporation limited geographical spread municipal bonds underdeveloped and tight credit allocations from pmnrf and pmcares donation drives from citizens and civil society
2020-04-05 20:19:55
i would especially like to emphasize page onwards where the methodology for calculating state share of sdrmf is given some people were complaining that why kerala has been allocated so less amount compared to maharashtra there were several speculations and baseless theories eg northsouth discrimination but none of the critical comments in my knowledge mentioned about the finance commission recommendations which is the actual reason none of them bothered to critique the recommendations i think this post provides a good chance to the people to critique the methodology adopted by xvfc in allocation of state share of sdrmf funds people critical of distribution of funds to various states can read page onwards this will help them base their criticism on actual facts rather than their imagination
you can give all the justification and due process you want we all know the real reason why delhi got
the short answer on why delhi did nt see a single paisa of this money is because the fifteenth finance commission xvfc has not included delhi in its recommendations this is because delhi is not a state yes so delhi must get money then directly from centres funds right like ndrf or the pm relief fund i m sure we have lots of funds for unforseen circumstances which have funds but can be used for this emergency especially with delhi becoming an epicentre after the tablighi fiasco

video of muslim vendor s unhygienic handling of fruits falsely linked with spreading coronavirus alt news

2020-04-05 19:05:52
i think most sensible people would have read this already rather spam this on whatsapp to who are still believing in such rumors
was looking to source to this thanks
dates back to february khan s daughter also claimed that due to his illness he constantly makes gestures of counting notes the same way he is seen counting the fruits we are not able to independently verify her claims the vendor s act was unarguably unhygienic however the issue has been grossly twisted on social media with several individuals terming it deliberate and calling for a boycott of muslim vendors earlier this week a video of a group practising a ritual in sufism was falsely shared as intentional sneezing inside nizamuddin mosque what he was doing may not be deliberately to spread or something like that but still is unhygienic he should still be taken to action his daughter s claim seems a bit false tbh never heard of anything like that as far as the sufism ritual stuff goes who cares if they are sneezing or not that s still incredibly unhygienic and will spread infections just because they arent actually sneezing doesnt make it clean or appropriate

govt to cut back containment ops only if no new case found for weeks

2020-04-05 18:48:06
where has the govt made this containment strategy public i wish to read it myself
however if the containment plan is not able to contain the outbreak and large numbers of cases start appearing then a decision will need to be taken by state administration to abandon the containment plan and start on mitigation activities this is what i was afraid of it seems our current strategy is to merely choke out the disease by not giving the virus any new hosts to infect this strategy while useful in the early days of an outbreak needs to be abandoned quickly we will never be able to achieve containment and because the virus can be transmitted even while asymptomatic it will never get truly choked out i honestly feel that we should have attempted a containandmitigate strategy about cases ago or moved to a mitigate strategy about a cases ago we tried to forcefully put a lid on a gushing fountain and ended up spreading it even further
do none of the morons in the government understand that to even produce essential items we need nonessential inputs if and when those supply chains break due to smaller firms being closed by a go insolvent due to cash flow issues we ll be looking at mass starvation and food riots further exacerbating an already worse situation

must read the plight of the indian farmer
a few hundred miles from south asia s glamour capital mumbai a new day is marked by the lifeless body of another indian farmer dangling from a peepul tree by a noose more than farmers have committed suicide in the last decade in maharashtra s vidarbha alone an area the size of portugal in central india however being an admirer of only the beautiful the middle class indian and their news is carefully sanitized of any mention about these starving sunburnt wretches that can not even afford the diet provided to one commercial european cow the indian farmer is invisible in life and in death thus while his ripe turgid oranges reach the gentleman s table this abomination of a human being vanishes into obscurity thrashed and ravaged by a burden of debt as the content hungry indian media looks at the shopping malls and celebrity gossip to fill their pages i do not intend to ruin the appetite of my fine educated compatriots on this forum by whining the demise of a two penny cotton orange farmer from india i am here to enlighten you all on the ways of making these useless deaths profitable the monsanto way in the monsanto ventured into india with its variety of genetically modified cotton seeds bt cotton in this introductory episode i would skip the illegalities of monsanto s field trials in india for which the indian supreme court suspended monsanto s indian trading rights until fast forward to monsanto s agents start approaching vidarbha s farmers about these bt cotton seeds later known as suicide seeds the seeds were expensive but monsanto had already arranged with indian banks for huge loan provisions to farmers who agreed the farmers were promised unimaginable profits from these superseeds mostly verbally most importantly monsanto s agents were nice personable and they actually addressed the indian farmers as if they were human beings when you are nice to the poor you take away their bargaining power unable to read or write these gullible uneducated farmers put their thumbprint in lieu of their signature on monsanto s agreement and approached banks for loans several times their annual revenue the loans were all approved without any hurdle the farmer was literally on a joyride for the first time in several generations in the eyes of the erudite this was a picture perfect move in one sweep millions of dollars of public money lying in the local banks became monsanto s money riding on shoulders of halfnaked cotton farmers of vidarbha then reality struck the crops failed they failed miserably when the farmers approached the same agents for answers the attitude was different from last time the agents pointed the illiterate farmer who is unable to even sign his name to a clause built into page x line y of the initial document the clause redeemed monsanto of failed harvest unless the farmer had also bought monsanto s very expensive fertilizer and pesticide as well the news broke as hellfire on the destitute farmer that was already on the brink of devastation from three failed cotton harvests there was no way for the farmer to afford these expensive fertilizers and pesticides obviously when the farmers approached the banks and local politicians on monsanto s payroll both referenced the same documents with the thumb print of the farmers and held the farmer alone responsible for their debt if you have decided to read on let me warn you that there is no silver lining until now after each harvest the farmers would save their indigenous seeds in local seed banks but they have not sown indigenous for past several harvest cycles so the older variety of indigenous seeds that the farmer sowed are no longer to be found and worse still monsanto has bought over all the local seed banks of cotton exported by india is bt cotton the indigenous varieties are all but extinct these were the same indigenous cotton varieties that once clad alexander s army the ancient romans and the egyptian pharaohs the native indian cotton that led europe into a global exploration for trade routes and set forth the age of explorations is all but gone at this point the vidarbha farmers give up the fight decide to swallow their loss and make the best of what they have in the absence of indigenous seeds they moved to sow the seeds from the previous monsanto harvest however the friendly monsanto agent came knocking back the agent pointed again to another clause in the agreement that declares monsanto s patent on the seeds and prohibits the farmers from resowing them the farmer is flabbergasted never before had they known that seeds can be patented farmer lobby groups took monsanto to court obviously monsanto prevailed monsanto s victory over the naked starving indian farmers was hugely celebrated in various disguise our very own nature called it a boost for research the patriotic nationalistic modi government refuses to talk about farmer suicides for several years it refused to publish the suicide numbers in nov when a huge rally of indian farmers marched to delhi begging for their justice and relief they were flogged and shot at by the indian police and not one mainstream indian media covered the story the memoirs of warren hastings the governor general of india describes the indian famine caused by atrocious policies of another multinational corporation the british east india trading company eic starving farmers would come to the city in the vain hope of finding leftovers discarded by the opulent employees of eic starving and diseased the indian farmers are an ungainly sight for three centuries now as the british sepoy would kick these wretched souls lining the street side the farmer would cry out in agony baba baba father father your countrymen have brought me to such misery if it pleases you i want to breath my last in your presence like yesterday the common people is just as engrossed in fighting each other and rioting to be able to see the real evil plaguing them india may have gained its own flag but it is far from being independent

we need to extend support and solidarity to minorities and marginalized sections of society rather than vilify them if we want them to keep coming forward to report coronavirus symptoms
we have all seen how muslims are being vilified after a muslim congregation sparked a new wave of cases list of names with addresses and mobile phone numbers of people who attended the tablighi jamaat event in delhi are circulating on social media given the communal narrative being spread against them this makes them extremely vulnerable to community backlash and hate crime a bjp health minister himself revealed the names age and locality of nizamuddin returnees who tested positive in his state in an official press conference he then asked the other jamaat attendees to also come forward to face the same treatment any guesses how many would willingly come forward now in most other parts of india so far the administration has made efforts to preserve patients anonymity but i guess these rules can be bent if there are special circumstances yes you could make an argument that other people need to know who they are so that they can stay away from them but that can be easily achieved by using hand stamps or home under quarantine stickers though imo even these methods should be employed only on willful violators but at least with these methods only your immediate neighbors will know rather than the entire citynation and any potential backlash will be minimized charging people with the draconian national security act which allows detention without charges or trial for up to a year is also counterproductive while that will definitely make violent people think twice before assaulting health workers ordinary muslims in up who are already deeply distrustful of the yogi government will now be even less forthcoming about their symptoms to health workers similarly by now we have all heard of how migrant workers were sprayed with bleach to disninfect them after being treated this way do you think any of them will still come forward if they start showing symptoms
2020-04-05 16:51:00
in odisha the spokesperson for the government and a muslim mla appealed to muslims to not be afraid and come forward to register and their identities will be kept secret thankfully the identities of none of our covid cases neither hindu or muslim have been leaked
also anyone who gets infected is a patient who needs treatment from a highly infectious fastspreading nondiscriminating virus not a terrorist or antinational has wrecked havoc across the world and everywhere governments are trying to find hospital beds ventilators and medicines for the ill and here in india we are trying to find who to blame
this jamaat gives media the opportunity to steer away attention from the stranded migrants situation so this wo nt stop jamaat guys infecting others is a better headline than the hungry crying migrant family pic coz it shows administration in bad light

my reality and the reality of a migrant worker is very different
our prime minister will tell you that we should light diyas to signify that we are in this together the fact is that we are not all suffering is not the same my reality and the reality of a migrant worker is very different any attempt to gloss over these differences is fatal to all efforts to create a better society a society where every attempt is made to leave no one behind they will tell you that we are all the same with their money tucked away safely while you worry about wether you will get your next paycheck or not they will tell you that we are all the same from the safety of their mansions and palaces while the poor the homeless the slumdwellers are slowly dying they will tell you that we are all the same after their meal of the day while a billion people wonder where they will get their ration from sab changasi

noble causes or novel virus are nt defeated by claps or candle vigils what s delivered through them is utmost respect for those that fight on the front lines it should come through own personal accord not because a dictator asked you to do so and i fuckin hate it when my phone buzzes like crazy with not only stupid whatsapp forwards but messages from banks and other apps lets face it this ruling party in power has the tendency to execute its ideas in the worst ill thought out way possible couple that with a society that s educated on whatsapp and they ll crank things up to in the end you ll have blackouts that s ventilators suddenly not working and being dependent on generators until power is restored so to compensate for human stupidity and save the electric grid mitron i ask of you to do the exact opposite tomorrow at i m gon na start my electric motor my microwave oven the electric kettle charge up my laptops phones and powerbanks turn on the tv fridge doors open so that it kicks in all lights on fans on basically i ll try to consume enough electricity so that when my neanderthal neighbours turn off their lights i save the electric grid and transformer in my area i urge you to do the same or do nt in the end this is a democracy and you should be able to exercise your right to choose

dear indians please read this post about harsh mander a retired civil servant who is feeding thousands of people a day
my fellow indians harsh mander a retired civil servant is feeding thousands of indians a day he is stepping up where the government is failing he and other volunteers with him are risking their lives to feed thousands of poor people they are stepping up where the government is failing it s citizens they are risking infection when we are sitting at home as if it s a vacation a few days ago the solicitor general of india put up fake and baseless allegations against harsh mander the allegations were that mr maser had made derogatory comments that brought disrepute to the supreme court the chief justice did not even hear to harsh mander s lawyer and scolded harsh mander for bringing disrepute to the supreme court they scolded him without even reading his speech and just based on what the solicitor general said these allegations against mr mander was made after he made complaints of hate speeches during the delhi riots excerpts from the hearing the chief justice of india cji said if this is what you feel about the court then we will have to decide what to do about you he also decided to defer a hate speech petition presented by mander till we sort this out we will not hear you but will hear others mander s lawyer dushyant dave pleaded with the judges please go through the entire speech the filing of the application by delhi police against mander is an attempt to browbeat him he is being put in the dock for nothing but again the court did not hear the full speech it continued to rely on the solicitor general s version now presumably supported by the police and it ordered mander to respond to the allegations and fixed an april date for the next hearing i request indians to please write an email to both the solicitor general and the chief justice of india the email should be polite courteous and should have accuracy of facts please write in the email that mr mander has been doing great service to the nation and such treatment of him is not appreciated by the citizens please humbly politely and respectfult remind both the solicitor general and the chief justice that the world is an uncertain place and that governments fall and rise in an instant this government too shall change one day the government may change but the citizens will remain the same and the citizens shall remember the conduct of the members of the legal system and that you fear that a lunatic like the one who showed mr adnan goswami his place may someday also remind the members of the legal system about their good and bad deeds and that the citizens of india shall remember the good and bad deeds long after this government has changed please send them a email together so that they both know that the email was sent to them together send it en masse so they wo nt be able to single out anybody if you are concerned about your privacy use a vpn and an anonymous email system found online please do nt let your message be rude vulgar or violent the message should be kind courteous and respectful

rajasthan doctor refuses to admit pregnant woman because she s muslim her child dies after delivery

2020-04-05 07:51:50
as someone from rajasthan and pretty horrified even if the allegations are true it is an allegation not proved india today has given the judgment in their headline with no corroborative reporting on their part it s a standard procedure in rajasthan to refer very critical patients to jaipur especially from nonbig cities like bharatpur so the alternative story the hospital administration is giving is plausible not saying the hospital administration is without blame even if what they are saying is true and i do believe its murder if what is being alleged is true
hate to be that guy but the only source saying she was refused admission because of her religion is her husband how many times have we seen reports of grief stricken kins beating up doctors for lack of care are we not going to give the doctor the benefit of doubt

priorities in the next few weeks testing tracing isolation and quarantine should remain the areas of focus external situation far from satisfactory and there was speculation of a possible second wave of the spread of the virus in some countries phase wise unwinding of lockdown people should not come out in hundreds on the roads pm suggested that the lifting of the lockdown be staggered earmarking some days for vehicles other days for cyclists and that fewer people should be in offices pm told the chief ministers that the country may need to enforce social distancing at least until diwali continuation of lockdown in some areas a limited lockdown in some areas is an option that seems to be gaining ground it may not be possible to reach a zeronewcase situation by april the best option would be to focus on specific pockets to contain the spread railway ministry zones are typically set to indicate to the railway ministry in the coming days if they have the capability to start with per cent of the usual services scaled up to per cent and the like depending on the government s lockdown strategy civil aviation ministry now what do the airlines do as a part of their contingency planning and to prepare for the future it is entirely up to the airline there is no directive from us
2020-04-05 06:06:07

so this happened with my food delivery
today i ordered some food from swiggy order status was showing delivery executive collected food and is on the way but from tracking his bike was showing off the route and it got delayed by min so i called executive and he said he is on the way and will meet me in min my apartment gate i thought maybe some gps tracking issue i went to gate to collect but he did not show up so i called him and he again said within min he will be there finally he delivered food when i checked gravy i found quantity was less than usual also some gravy was over the package i immediately felt something is fishy i suspect that he took away some part of food i opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered i could not report the case after waiting for while i cancelled order from my end to get refund and got back i was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far more than hour now i dont think swiggy is at fault here and i am also not sure with my suspicion what do you think of it guys tldr order got delivered late i suspect food was taken away no confirmation of order deliverey had to cancel myself despite receiving package got refund but feel something is fishy
2020-04-05 05:40:02
i would say please do nt place the accusation with swiggy unless you re sure the delivery executive did something fishy i had my zomato order delayed last week app showed him at the same place for a long time was getting annoyed because the pizza would go cold and the restaurant was hardly minutes away when i called him he said he was delivering double orders due to the lock down when i probed further he revealed that the other order was placed for one address but the customer asked him to deliver to another which was far off when the executive refused saying he ll be penalized for going off route they insisted he come there and they d pay him or bucks being the naive fellow he was he s gone there for the money and guess what they ve given him bucks when he expressed his disappointment they ve attempted to assault him he was pretty shaken up i told him not to worry and come to my place tipped him well and i was even more sad because the guy was very young i learnt not to act hastily without empathy
he was likely hoping that you cancel the order i have also heard of people taking the order ans asking delivery guy to not mark it as delivered and instead cancelling the order this i heard from a ex delivery guy

pakistan doesn t have an ac of its own opposite to that china currently has acs namely laoning shandong the later of which was inducted towards the end of with this china s power projection through it s pla navy has increased by leaps bounds and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including india china is working on getting more acs by so that it can get under control the whole of ioc till date ioc has been guarded by india navy in coordination with japanese south korean navy pla navy ac shandong indian navy s top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of pla navy to effectively guard the ioc region it needs a ac which if accepted by govt of india goi will be india s indigenous ac called ins vishal a bigger tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch the only problem is lack of funds as its construction operationalization over a period of years will cost a hefty billion or crore due to this reason goi is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a ac for indian navy indiaaustralia navy officers but there might be a solution to this problem and that is sharing an ac jointly by nations namely india australia japan south korea indian can have a share in its ownership while the remaining countries can have each this will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all countries i am hereby sharing the following points about it it can be built in years if its construction commences in the half of this can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all participating countries having a joint ac will reduce its overall cost including construction maintenance bring it down to for each country it can be built in years if its construction commences in the half of this can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all participating countries each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as japan for its electrical electronic parts australia and south korea for their weapon packages crew and india for its expertise in hull designing since it will be constructed by countries jointly it can be the best ac built till date as will have the best of features from different countries a huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany guard it which will comprise of missile cruisers frigates destroyers submarines supply ships joint operations functioning that will further cement international ties between all south asian countries that will also include sharing of knowledge among officers sailors automatic threatneutralisation from china s pla navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint ac as doing so will bring it to war against countries of which are developed are developing economies b taking off from us aircraft carrier one point that can be decided later is the type of aircraft that will operate from it now this can be the latest generation stealth fighters such as lockheed martin s or the generation boeing s super hornet blockiii now except india all countries have already ordered for their airforce modernization plans so they can easily get the which have been specially designed to be operated from acs but again doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint ac which inturn won t be feasible add to it while the other countries are also nato members us won t be willing to allow access of with indian navy officers sailors on the ac as it will help them get the technical and mechanical knowhow of which they might share with iaf drdo hal to help them make their own generation amca advanced medium combat aircraft super hornet on the other hand opting for super hornet blockiii would be a costefficient step and will be welcomed by one and all the us won t mind sharing of technical mechanical knowhow about their latest variant of generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to indian navy and indian airforce for their respective requirements of jets and jets respectively indian navy s fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of super hornets as it will also get them hand experience of flying these beasts jsdf japan navy ships during malabar exercise with india now it only depends on the top leadership of all countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not to effectively check the chinese threat in ioc it is only a matter of time coz once if pla navy gets its ac possibly by then they might not be willing to back down but if india japan australia and south korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint ac a joint strike group along with it together by then china would think twice before messing with it

japan is under us military umbrella not to mention that us has bases in all these countriesthey do nt need us
us seventh fleet operates out of japan japan has large helicopter carriers which i m sure can embark the stol version of the south korea comes under the us umbrella and can ask for protection at any time should they require it australia also has a couple of helo carriers they can embark the on all in all the ultimate way to beat a chinese naval force in those waters is not with the brute force if an aircraft carrier but with multiple sea denial actions wherein the chinese carriers are not allowed to operate freely for example patrolling the strait of malacca effectivepy can quickly put an end to any ambition of putting chinese carriers in the indian ocean which is why the base in the andamans is insanely important also many countries in that region are not that close to china should there be any aggression you can almost guarantee support because they re also in the line of fire
do nt you think we need hospitals and schools colleges more than we need aircraft carriers the military might of usa did nt protect their population from unemployment poverty or a dangerously stupid president elected by an illiterate brainwashed voter base

need clarification about caanrc in assam how are they related
so nrc is an exercise done nationwide to identify citizens and illegals it is first being done in assam as the population there is fed up of bangali illegals the nrc ended up recognising million people out of million as citizens in assam it ended up making million people stateless still being able to appeal and of those thousands are hindus then the caa came it is supposed to fast track citizenship to immigrants who are of certain religions coming from neighboring muslim countriesand prevent them from being illegals this discrimination will apply to most states but the caa does nt apply to states like assam so are nrccaa even a problem in assam and what is the fate of those hindus in assam and finally why does the act only cover immigrants until should nt it be an ongoing thing my opinion about the whole nrc is that it s an unnecessary exercise creating stress and anxiety to large parts of population in the country which are already poor the idea of containing muslim population is not that bad in my opinion because if they become too many then problems start but this whole exercise is unnecessary and a failure as both assam activists are angry and large parts of the population have been made even more miserable india should focus on strengthening its borders and not allow muslim illegals from neighboring countries but why create all this unnecessary stress and suffering in the population already living in india

animation is dying in india dude sorry yo say this but that is a fact the amount of work and time required is not justified as per the companies and the industry is moving towards for it s ease of use i am a animator in a small studio and trust me when i say this you need a lot of patience and all the gloomy dreams you have will be gone my co workers are bunch engineering students who just know the way software works and nothing else no principles and no technical knowledge this is the way it is in the end all i can say is work hard even if you do nt get a animation gig try for storyboard artists or something like that do nt stop practice and try to perfect your understanding of animation principles and figure drawing

this post is going viral to defend the government in not preparing us for the situation i thought i will respond to that with some facts
dear honourable prime minister of india i need to tell you something they do nt like you he knows it and thrives on it and he also knows there are millions of fool who will fall for his gimmick and won t have courage to ask real and important questions to be honest they never really liked you but even in this time of our biggest existential crisis also when you need all of us every single citizen of india to back you with all our might they do nt like you they do nt like you when you take a daring decision to lock down a country of billion people to save their own lives over scientists doctors call upon the government to reveal post lockdown plan they do nt like you when you send flights to get back your countrymen from the riskiest areas to relative safety they say but the migrants had to walk indians stuck abroad but government wants them to wait hungry laborers appeal to pm they still do nt like you as you send thousands of buses overnight to bring back migrants to their hometowns as now they say migrants are at risk because of the crowding free for privileged double fare for poor maybe they are expecting you to arrange one cab per person or build them homes overnight with stashes of cash wherever they are whatever it may be but they do nt like you no we wanted him to assure them that they will be taken care of in terms of food shelter and social security in his minutes monologue before announcing the lockdown which would not make this exodus in the first place or maybe numbers would have been very low why not local ngos volunteers were utilized to help them why were not a single state cm was consulted before announcing nationwide lockdown pm should have consulted state governments before announcing lockdown says chattisgarh cm as the head of a developing nation taking a big hit on the economy you lock down the country at a time and stage where half the world was roaming around in gardens and paid a hefty price with their lives where some socalled heads of powerful nations the socalled buck stops here heads could not even dare to lock down a state you executed the world s largest lockdown in the history of mankind they still do nt like you because they know what impact it will have on the stability of their country if they took a decision like this without proper planning and execution not everyone has the privilege of being illiterate and herds of followers who will listen to all his bullshit and won t dare to ask a single question period they do nt like you for the confidence and morale boosting in your speech that united and channelized an entire nation of a billion and they still do nt like you when you exude humility and awareness of the situation by apologising to the poor of the country for having to do this to them and the nation once again for god s sake we don t need team building activities in such crisis we want to what is his plan to bring us out of this situation he s a prime minister not hr they do nt like you when you release an economic package for the poor kerala government announces crore economic package why there is no push to bring one nation one ration card they do nt like you when you repeatedly ask them with folded hands to stay at home to save their own freaking lives they do nt like you when you beg them to express gratitude for the unsung heroes while your government is bringing in test kits from korea and germany and setting up required facilities on a war footing first testing kit manufacture only got an approval on march again the government was playing favourism until saket gokhale file an rti then only they approved another manufacturer tweet tweet now sir these are the same folks who can not even figure out how to entertain themselves and their family of four for days but they expect you to have a perfect solution to the problem of billion people of different needs this statement makes me doubt your intellect coronavirus shivsena blames pm modi s taali bajao call for casual approach of people to lockdown explained grid challenges to the sunday night blackout plan these are the same folks who may not even have helped their neighbours or maids in need but they want you to distribute money to the needy equally without lapses overnight we have been warned by who opposition leader and so many experts that coronavirus will be a be a big challenge in the coming days and we must prepare for the same but apparently conducting an event with lakhs of people to welcome trump eating lithi choka delhi election and pogrom and toppling mp government was the biggest priority some of them cant even manage their home budget with a huge salary but they want you to manage the economy in these testing times without failures again don t act like it has happened all of sudden we had first positive case in last week of january some of them ca nt attend their offices or meetings on time and some may not even wake up on time despite alarm clocks but they want you to announce the lockdown in the morning to give them time to hoard and stash the essentials now i feel stupid to answer your idiotic statements as if and announcement in the morning will have a different impact silly their walls are filled with pictures of police charging protesters even if it was to save their own lives but their walls shamelessly avoid posting thousands of indians stuck in the the middleeast brought back in air india planes i know by mentioning the middle east where you re subtly pointing out and i won t encourage you by replying anything to that because admit it people like you thrive on this their walls are filled with posts on migrants sufferings but never a single post on what could be the solution to save lives without collateral damage their walls shamelessly avoid showing sikhs doing langar muslims opening up their hotels to feed the needy christians opening their hearts to not just humans but also the suffering dogs on the roads common men opening kitchens ordinary people working with government employees to distribute money goods food do nt be surprised why they do nt like you they do nt like you because for them you are part of a political party and ideology which they admonish and the fact that you won the a majority in indian elections twice which they have neither the capacity nor the maturity to digest alas if and only if for one moment they could treat you as the head of the nation head of their nation the prime minister of india but still they do nt like you please go and check his attendance in parliament and forget that just check for how many days he was in india in last years and sir you you are at fault you do nt boast of your government s humongous efforts to be the first one to bring in thousands of indians back home without even thinking for a second about their race religion language orientation or even citizenship indians stuck abroad but government wants them to wait you do nt boast of the fact that our first quarantine establishment of the indotibetan border police was positioned even before the first coronavirus case in india surfaced i could not find any record confirming when itbp quarantine was established on their official website but the testing on airports started on march that s almost months after patient zero in india coronavirus outbreak airports start stringent screening of passengers ground report by vikram sharma on march at igi airport you do nt publicise how your railway compartments are turned into a quarantine zone a first of its kind in the world bjp advertising lunch offered to stranded laborers bjp advertising ration given to laborers in four years modi govt spent over rs crores on publicity rti shows you do nt market all the efforts your billionaire industrialists in the country are putting in to ensure the health infrastructure is expanded rapidly to meet the demands of the present crisis and the future motive suspect on setting up pm cares cpim modi is waving lakh crores of corporate loans you do nt question the protesters gang the award returnee gang the afraid gang the pseudointellectual gang while they are all shamelessly hiding wrapped their tails around them when the country needs them the most pandemic social organizzations provide food to needy tweeting or posting anything in opposition to any steps the government takes is their only quarantine plan when does asking questions from the government became wrong aren t we living in a democratic nation can you tell me what concrete steps our government is planning to take to stabilize our economy and improve healthcare your government will still serve them all and protect them all just as any other citizen of india but they still wo nt like you isn t this what they were elected for in the first place the only thing modi and his government have done so far to make us all feel that he s the ringmaster you can t or shouldn t question him if you do he will never answer but when you insist then his he will release the it cell goons on you and so far he s successful because there are a bunch of you who will follow him without questioning why modiji ne kiya hai to kuch soch ke hi kiya hoga let me break it for you modi ne kiya hai to bina soche hi kiya hoga and your face sir it still hides the dilemma and the helplessness you deal with i for sure see the agony behind that confident smiling but serious face for which saving the lives of each and every individual is personal very personal and i can see that congress extends full support and cooperation to govet sonia to pm i can see the tradeoff you face of having to selfdestroy the economy for saving the nerve the life of this nation its people of all races regions religions economic stature and political orientation even the traitors no you idiot there is always a middle ground which most of the nations are taking except our unesco best awardee do you even know what is the situation of our economy and healthcare but hey probably we ll get a new statue soon and it is his job to save the nation its people of all races regions religions economic stature and political

i think government ca nt extend this complete lockdown much given the economic cost to such a decision according to who indian government is looking for time with lockdown of days which means india was to get prepared with specialised rooms and wards for patients ventilators ppe quality masks if not working supply chains of all essential items trainings of armed forces and medical practitioners more testing would result in more checks and readiness which was lacking till nowrecent approval of indigenous testing kits by ms minal d bhonsale of mylab which could give result in is a welcome step and will help in giving clear picture of the crisis south korea and singapore could contain the crisis only because of more tests and precautions thereafter there is also a hope from mit led research which proved that continous temperature of could halt the virus spreadaccording to imd officials the temperature would continously increase in comming days if padma bhushan dr nageshwar reddy is to be believed most important thing is that when this virus spread to say italy or the us or to india the genotypes of this virus turned out to be different sequencing of the whole virus has been done in four countries the first in the usa second in italy third in china and fourth in india what they are finding is that this virus has a different genome sequencing in india compared to say italy this has a lot of significance because in the indian virus there is a single mutation occuring in the spike protein of the genome spike protein is the area that attaches to the human cell one small mutation has happened making that attachment weak so this will become an important factor for us in india a total lockdown for a month would take of gdpfiscal deficit would further down and npa more than according to raghuram rajan this is a very serious concern because not only does the lockdown keep people from going to work it keeps them at home which is not necessarily that pristine isolated place but can also be a slum where people live together it is very important for india to not reach stage of community transmissionif stringent measures are to be taken government must not shy away from doing so lockdown must be for schooluniversities your travel holidays park clubs functions of gatherings etc and people of age must not be allowed to come out we must be hopeful for the above factors of temperature and genome sequencing and keep our fingers crossed for ours and health of our fellow citizens
2020-04-05 02:55:42
ideally it should be extended but we ca nt be sure with the present government
this needs to be extended till we see a slowdown for weeks
do nt be too hopeful of the high temperature s theory and distinct genome theory while high temperature and humidity could theoretically slow down transmission it will not be enough in an overcrowded country like ours and there is no proof that the different spike protein makes the virus less virulent just a hopeful hunch

pitting a community against a political party is fucking stupid
first of all let me start by saying it was stupid whatever some muslims did at nizamuddin and still are doing by staying hidden and not letting the authorities do their work efficiently but this rant is not just about this situation it is about people s ignorance and lack of knowledge people do nt understand what is propoganda and they do nt know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party no bjp does not represent hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists so when i say fuck bjp it means fuck the politicians who are making this country burn bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other and paint muslims as someone who are gon na attack hindus for no reason regardless of what people want a political party s job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country what part of this people do nt undertstand and why are dalits even supporting bjp s assholes they beat up dalits discriminate against them all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country everyone is crazy about religion i say fuck religion if you believe in a higher power that is cool i do nt care but killing in the name of god fuck no had to get this off my chest sorry and thanks for reading if you made it to the end if you have any objections to what i have said i can conversate or debate sanely but please stop the craziness use your brains i do nt care what your parents uncle aunties believe in use your own brains otherwise india is not gon na stay a democratic country and this is not even a baseless fact anymore it s all around us we just close our eyes to look around
2020-04-05 02:28:28
our country is just too far in at the moment and there s no turning back now our best hope is to believe that we make it to the other side without taking too much damage something much worse than the riots is ahead of us it always was but now with the situation acting as a catalyst we are going to reach there sooner
a couple of points i think india is inherently fragile bjp has not invented something they are just leveraging the pre existing fault lines another thing is that there are so many people who vote for bjp because they are so fed up with the opposition i don t know exactly but rahul gandhi wouldn t get a lot of crowd in my tiny village a substantial part of this country do not care about democracy people don t like having to make difficult decisions don t consider this as a debate to your points just my pov
bjp stands for divisive politics in a state where the minority is a majority they play the outsider insider politics a place where the majority is the majority the play the caste wala card bjp is being run like an efficient political business so i do nt see when and how it can be stopped

under the new law those who have resided for years or studied for seven years in the union territory of jammu and kashmir are now eligible to become permanent residents if residing years in region isnt enough get rights what would be the alterate way to provide them experts and human rights activists say that the new law has triggered fears of demographic changes and warn about renewal of tensions in the muslimmajority himalayan region human rights activist might have might have missed the point insted of fighting for people who dont have same rights as residents despite being part of the community for more than years they are fighting against the provision of such rights yes residents association can fight against dilution of requirement but human rights lawyers fighting against equal rights isnt sounding good
i do nt see anything overly wrong with this the new residents are infact indians not people of some other country implied in the word nonnatives the j k residents are nt getting restricted from their rights or practicing their traditions tbh if worrying about outside influence in your big problem that seems as if you re perceiving it as a different country altogether

i m from goa and im looking to purchase a digital piano i ve gone through a lot of technical details between the roland and the yamaha from past month now quarantining my ass off on this comparisons i know the is a better choice but the prices here in india i think i ll have to sell a kidney to buy the roland its stupidly high roland goes for rs or roland goes for rs or yamaha goes for rs or i know the digital sounds can easily be replaced after doing the midi wizardry im a soft dev so i can handle those technicalities easily later and by the looks of it both the rolands above have tri sensor keys which will yield much better midi data in case i do decide to swap out the sounds for post processing i dont know the right term for this thats why i prefer the rolands for now and ofcourse because of their action no i have nt tried them yet because guess what noone even has them on display here in the entire state my questions yamaha or roland which will age better lot of roland youtube videos complaining about loud keynoise after months of usage while yamaha has no complains on the same im planing to use this keyboard untill it fails to work or dies on me years easily is that price tag justifiable for roland i mean should i pay just for the key sensors want to be able to learn complex arrangements of classical music later on like beethoven moonlight sonata movement which should also be fine on yamaha right do the rolands in india have bluetooth connectivity most indian sites say does not come with bluetooth which i sort of need anyone in india purchased this can i just use an addon accessory via the usb to host to transmit the bluetooth data to my computer because in this case i can then get the yamaha and purchase the accessory

if you are mostly looking for accurate midi data only then why not go for a midi keyboard with proper fully weighted keys something like m audio hammer will be slightly cheaper and you will get a high quality keybed
hey i think your best bet would be to contact someone from furtados and get their opinion where were you planning on buying it from

netflix extremely slow on jio
i recently switched from airtel to reliance jio for my mobile internet because someone recommended it to me everything else works fine however netflix is absolutely horrible i watch using the netflix app on my phone with airtel i barely had any lag both while watching and downloading whereas with jio it takes upto minutes after hitting play for playback to actually begin downloads either do not work or download extremely slowly often at a rate of kbps anyone else experiencing this
2020-04-04 21:44:08
if it has happened recently then it could be because of streaming sites limiting their server capacity as to serve a larger amount of people amid this lockdown just yesterday i got notification from prime that its limiting the quality especially for people using mobile networks
when i complained about slow internet in my area jio care replied that there are too many people on the area and and the slow issue is due to the load response sounded like deal with it there are ares in my city where jio internet is too slow

why is there concern that the pm lightsout could impact india s electricity grid

2020-04-04 21:06:19
basically the power grid is not designed in a manner where it can handle a mass shut off followed by a mass trun on the power grid is balanced like a seesaw you cant go to either extremes without cautions planning and fail safes
the sudden power loss in one unit will start triggering power outage as the grid difficult to divert the incoming power so the incoming power is diverted to another grid which would fail with overload and this continue to trigger a nation wide black out as our grids are somehow interconnected in clusters the overload forced the power plant to shutdown to prevent damage to the equipments a shutdown to resume to normal will take more than hours therefore there will be a black out icus usually have diesel generators as back up but it can handle only emergency requirements such as ventilators etc expect a power outage which would last until next day unless the grid people is stopping the power to be drawn that means whether you like it or not they would just cut off your electricity so don t be in lift during those times

we would have gone into a recession regardless of a virus part rant
people seem to forget we already had major financial issues that no one is really highlighting such as the bad rollout of demonetization the ilfs issue leading to an npa issue the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas the consolidation of banks the issues with yes bank and the impending nbfc crisis on top of it air india s bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past years internationally such as the trade war brexit and currently the oil war between saudi arabia and russia the virus is nt something that would have wrecked the economy itself it s something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues the situation is right now not similar to because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right this is a trust issue in the markets and economics there is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce we will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover the stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything if trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it s based on perceptions you have nt actually lost the money as long as you do nt book your losses for a person who had invested years back in a stock he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised that s why all these instruments come with terms and conditions if a share falls by that does nt mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose of their intrinsic value over minutes on the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had preexisting skeletons in the closet it s going to be horrible for them this time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a china propoganda or lockdown bad thing it s sad to see people lose their jobs but it does nt matter weather million lose their jobs every year or mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually there is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in india tracing far back as it s ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy the informal sector your vegetable vendors your kirana shops your local chai walla are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure healthcare and education the investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time i hope after all this is done people do nt forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running

well written thoughts this corona virus outbreak is a godsend for this government to bury all their misgovernance and failures in economic policies in deep when we recover from this virus still they can continue to blame on the virus until next general election announced and during that time the islamic monster will suddenly appear from bjp closets

there have been reports of a blackout possibility due to sudden drop in power when most of india is going to shut their lights off though modiji has only asked for lights to be off i am sure a lot of people are going to switch off everything that includes fridge fans etc a surge in demand which will be too high or too low can lead to outages as per reports it s like suddenly putting a brake of a car in motion or suddenly pushing the accelerator to the floor it is difficult to predict how the car will exactly behave it is the same predicament but much more complicated that we all are facing said a senior executive from the power sector

about the tablighi jamat situation
i saw this hit piece on aaj tak about how the jamat members in ghaziabad allegedly passed lewd remarks at female nurses sang vulgar songs and dropped their pants which is absolutely hilarious to me of course you ca nt put anything past anyone these days but i highly doubt that the people who spend most of their lives away from civilization locked in mosques around the world praying and talking about praying when they re not actually praying would do anything like that that is literally the mission of the tablighi jamat they re basically muslim sanyasis seriously it s a matter of pride for them that they have nothing to do with the material world as they call it they re literally oblivious which exactly why they did nt pay heed to the coronavirus situation granted that was extremely dangerous and wrong but i still very much doubt that these people even know any vulgar songs much less that they can muster the courage to sing any in unison to harass the nurses obviously there is zero proof of any such occurrence aaj tak basically hovered over a letter from the hospital staff for a few seconds which said that these patients were being uncooperative with no mention of lewd behaviour while yelling about jamatiyon ki kaali kartoot sure maybe they have been uncooperative because they re stubborn fools but i doubt the other stuff about them dropping their pants is real lmfao of course this is my opinion based on my knowledge and experiences and everyone is free to believe what they want but i d encourage you to exercise a healthy amount of skepticism while watching news these days more so when you re sitting with your family watching channels like aaj tak or zee news i know boomers love sensationalized news stories do nt believe any of it until you see absolutely concrete proof most people here know this but these channels are trying to push a narrative with support from certain people and they ll go to any lengths to do so facts and consequences do nt matter to these people as long as they get more viewers it s a winwin for them their overseers get to disseminate propaganda and stay happy with them while they get trp then they can say things like aaj tak ne sabko pacchada no since the beginning of time and rub it in your faces
2020-04-04 20:22:46
do you try to search something before going on a rant aaj tak basically hovered over a letter from the hospital staff for a few seconds which said that these patients were being uncooperative with no mention of lewd behaviour while yelling about jamatiyon ki kaali kartoot it has the letter linked the claim is from cmo ghaziabad aaj tak and zee news concentrating on blaming muslims rather than talking about issues is nt new but the letter they hovered over does mention those things now how much is true and how much is exaggeration can be found only after proper investigation it just a allegation from cmo at this point and days old today
i find it hard to believe that they were spitting going nude and harassing nurses and staff without any evidence i mean did nt anyone there try to record it today even the most mild thing gets recorded and not one of them did

india s internet shutdown laws must be reformed
tl dr we wrote to the department of telecommunications and the ministry of parliamentary affairs to ensure reform of india s internet shutdown laws remains a priority for the government we have relied on the observations made by the supreme court in anuradha bhasin v union of india about gaps in the telecom suspension rules to urge for review of the rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment background on january the supreme court delivered its judgement in anuradha bhasin v union of india this case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in jammu and kashmir on august and it highlighted deficiencies in india s internet shutdown framework the court noted that the telecom suspension rules had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders as a temporary stopgap measure the court put in place two adhoc procedural safeguards first the court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published second the court directed the review committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days unfortunately even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like jabalpur without any publication of order the government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in anuradha bhasin v union of india but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the telecom suspension rules in response to a parliamentary question the minister of state for communications stated in rajya sabha on february that the government will review the rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the supreme court s observations to ensure the government follows up with this assurance we have written to the department of telecommunications and the ministry of parliamentary affairs recommendations for department of telecommunications we first wrote to the department of telecommunications under the ministry of communications on february and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in india in particular we urged the department to commence a public consultation to review the telecom suspension rules we also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all states and union territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the supreme court in anuradha bhasin v union of india noting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government we have requested the department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns we suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the cellular operators association of india estimating that telecom operators lose rs million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling recommendations for ministry of parliamentary affairs we also wrote to the ministry of parliamentary affairs on april to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the minister of state for communications in rajya sabha about review of telecom suspension rules as per the government of india allocation of business rules the ministry of parliamentary affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in parliament monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before parliament assurances made in parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within months however in this case the department of telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the telecom suspension rules including putting out a call for public consultation we recognize that due to the pandemic the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many therefore even if there is an extension of implementation timelines review of the telecom suspension rules must remain a priority and the parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the ministry of communications important documents representation dated sent to moc and meity link representation dated sent to mop and ml j link we re in this for the long haul support sustained advocacy against internet shutdowns by becoming an iff member today and don t forget to join our forum for closer dialogue with the iff staff and community about technology society and law

could lockdown be lifted partially in certain states
given the current situation it will be a long time before cases stabilize in all of india but what about states that achieve success early on and have no reported cases for a signiaficant duration of time is it possible for lockdown to be lifted early in such places how perfectly can states isolate themselves from each other if really well then i believe going this route would benefit a lot of people thoughts edit not sure how effective border sealing might be learnt today that one of my friends was able to go to ap from bangalore even though a lockdown is in place just because he had some connections in the police

yes that s what they are referring to a staggered exit the national lockdown maybe lifted on april but hotspot states will continue their lockdown with strict border control to prevent the further spread at least this is what i think would happen
yes they dont have plans to extend beyong april there are looking for an exit strategy they will gradually restore the services travel between states can still be controlled by closing the borders
i do nt think so

ban on extended till april in j k
just fucking angry at the time and wanted to rant about how we are being deprived of basic human rights there is a fucking lockdown going on and all we have is a shitty connection for our entertainment after seeing how many news outlets were posting about lifting the ban on in the ut i finally thought that yes on april maybe the govt will have some sense knocked onto them and they maybe able to see us as human and not as some fucking votes yeah just really looking forward to the diya jalao movement at least it will provide some fucking entertainment seeing these dumbfucks following the supreme leader mindlessly

this video is perhaps the first investigative journalismstyle video i ve attempted titled pcos sexual diseases diabetes and thyroid disorders role of packet milk exposed the video critically examine the hidden link between consumption of milk in plastic polybags and development of pcos

2020-04-04 18:38:58
i am dr felix bast associate professor ready to answer your queries
thanks for the video my question is why specifically the north indian population is affected when the milk distribution in southern india too has been done using plastic pouches secondly with regards to regulation most of the milk federation are government run or are based on cooperative bodies but don t they come under ministry of health aren t there directions from them if the pcos cases have been so prevalent thirdly norms from pollution control boards have to be tweaked to control this any idea since how long have the suggestions been submitted to find alternative forms of distribution
hello mrfelix thanks for the wonderful video a family member has pcos and the reasons we heard from doc was that it s pretty common due to lifestyle changes in the current generation never in my wildest dreams did i know that a simple milk packet can lead to pcos through ldpe since i live in a city where access to milkman is limited is it better to avoid milk i also heard that most indians out of are lactose intolerant so i feel it s better to avoid milk

public health policy lessons from the current pandemic
the current pandemic clearly shows that instead of focusing on insurance based health services through ayushman bharat india should have focused on strengthening the public health facilities further we need to increase the total budgetary spending on public health instead of leaving health services to the private sector what are your opinions about it
2020-04-04 18:32:30
i think its irrational to expect we ll achieve more by allocating more money for the govt to spend on a particular sector when it loses a lot of the money anyways to corruptionscams the govt is already spending on ayush for instance if you increase budgetary spending how do you know it ll go to actual medical treatment and infra instead of ayush the govt needs to spend the money it has allocated correctly first only then we should focus on increase the amount of money allocated

modi s call to turn off lights on april may lead to blackout warns maharashtra minister after pm asks to switch off lights tn discom prepares for sudden dip and surge in grid pms april blackout call puts power sector on alert mode to maintain grid stability pm modi s solidarity call here s why the challenge is unprecedented for the power industry during this lights out initiative about mw of power demand is expected to vanish according to estimates by power industry experts so posoco needs to ramp down electricity supply accordingly during this time block and ramp up again once this period is over and the baseload demand returns in full strength any missteps in handling this could possibly lead to a high voltage surge tripping the lines causing damage to the national grid and an extended power outage

call to consolidated action
there are a few things that have become clear in the past couple of weeks of lockdown as well as the coverage of it around india and the central government s response india is headed in the same direction spain is when it comes to looking at the numbers it took us weeks to reach cases days to reach and to reach the growth is indicative that we are going to see a massive increase in cases irrespective of whether we are in lockdown or not simply because the cases already existed prior to lockdown and now we are finally identifying the cases which have already spread prior to march the government is ill prepared and it will show in the coming days whether we like it or not we will be losing more indians we will be seeing more images of hardships being faced by the poor and by our healthcare workers the bjp has only gone and done it again and communalised the issue we have somehow made this the tablighi janata outbreak and have pinned everything on that when there are massive clusters of people meeting in ayodhya or bjp ministers in the south holding pujas my point is nt oh look at hindus it s the fact that religion is irrelevant and any sort of public gathering is detrimental to us the media and the bjp are only focusing on the muslims further propagating the narrative that this is something which they are spreading and portraying them as the enemy of the state subramaniam swamy and his vice interview have highlighted the bjps agenda in a crystal clear manner i have personally never voted for the bjp including in as i was always aware of the rss manifesto that drove their agenda and now we are finally seeing years of systematic indoctrinated bigotry become fully a part of the central government s agenda but what is truly horrifying is going through the comments of the vice video and watching all these bhakts condemning vice and telling them to stop with social justice and going ahead and justifying the bjps agenda the bots of the bjp have gotten exactly what they wanted through such a government these sort of exclusionary policies are not outrageous to their base but are exactly the platform the bjp has run on since the gujarat model they are really out here partying like it s through all of this there is one plea i make of you please hold your leaders accountable when it comes to covid the one thing that is obvious is that this is only the start for india bhakts will have their reality check because as this virus spreads it is completely indiscriminate it will affect them it will kill their parents it will kill their children it will kill them just as much as it could kill my family me your family or a muslim as the number of infections and deaths rise in india it is our duty to consistently hold our leaders responsible for acting do not blame anyone else not the tabhligi jamaat goers not the ones who went to ayodhya hold your elected officials accountable they are making this a communal issue when this disease is going to kill irrespective of religion i write this as someone with a lot of time on their hands but a lot of angst and anxiety in my mind because of the obvious direction this country is moving towards covid or no covid but this extraordinary time provides us with the opportunity to truly test our leaders and hold them responsible for the course our country takes i honestly want to do a lot more and genuinely find an avenue to express this sort of discontent that is not just limited to like minded people like me i know that places like reddit and instagram can be echo chambers in a lot of ways and i want to actively break out of that if any of you share similar concerns but genuinely have ideas on how we can consolidate please message me or comment we have the time and we have the modes the one thing that the government can not stop is a digital movement the only point is we have to consolidate and act uniformly what do you think is the way forward for a group of disenfranchised citizens who genuinely care about the future of this country what are ways you think we could call out major media outlets or officials in a legitimate way what do you think are basic principles which we have to hold our officials up to

we are facing one of the most challenging times in human history we are facing one of the most severe medical crises since which will have economic effects that may rival or exceed the great depression in such a time there is global deffecit of leadership from modi in india to trump in america
there is a global crises of leadership under trump and his america first policy america has receded from the world stage leaving space for china space which china used to gain influence over the who the current chief of the who always had a favourable standing with china with his rival for the chairmanship of the who dr david nabarro alleging during the race for the chairmanship that the current who chief has close contacts with china and it s leadership these allegations are further reaffirmed when the who chief went to wuhan on the of january and issued a formal statement that there is no human to human transmission of the corona virus the above events show trump s failing as a global leader and the recession of one of the major democratic players from the world stage trump also took the corona virus very very lightly downplaying the intelligence over the same provided by his own national agencies he has previously ignored serious advisories by his national agencies for example russia s interference in us elections and the khashguni murders now coming to india no political party in india has ever worked on the health infrastructure other than a few marquee projects like building one or two aiims this is the same for this government as well however other governments failings do not justify this governments lack of action with regards to building health facilities currently india has doctors per thousand patients which is well below recommended standard i m sure even this figure is inflated as of late the government has started to recognise or offering bridge programs to ayush doctors when the delhi state government started to build mohalla clinics then the current ruling national government tried it s best to stop their development the dda which is controlled by the central government did nt alot them any land forcing mohalla clinics to be built on the side of the roads in porta cabins as they were on the side of the roads they are cramped such cramped atmosphere promoted for the spread of the disease now the government knows that it s going to loose this war if a vaccine does nt come out soon and to be very frank a vaccine will take at least months so now the ruling dispensation is trying to divert attention on communal grounds helped by the fact that one religious gathering carried the corona virus all over the country in the same way that a religious community spread it in south korea the question is whether now this crisis plays a role in removing these leaders and making way for a more sensible breed of leadership or whether it strengthens their grip on power as has happened in hungary edit i would also like to add that the current ruling dispensation in india also is trying to divert the entire attention to a particular sect that has spread the virus in india it s doing so that it can divert attention from the mass exodus of migrant workers and according to the governments own admission in the supreme court in people from that mass exodus have a very high probability of having couple that mass exodus of carriers with weakened immune system of massive malnourishment present in the rural populace will result in a higher deaths rate even among a younger populace edit now trump has stopped shipment of masks which was ment for and paid for by other countries in fact a shipment of which was just transiting through a us port disappeared the shipment was heading to germany is trump crazy he is isolating america and americans at their time of greatest needs for example germany is a major industrial power it may manufacturer components that are needed in circuit boards of ventilators what if it stopped the shipment of those circuit boards canada has already pointed out that a lot of all nurses go from windsor ontario to north american cities like detroit this just shows the deffecit of good world leaders that truly have the best interest of the world and their countries at heart

opinion what s the point of being religious if it does nt rid you of basic human vices
one of my neighbours and their family are super religious they conduct loud pujas during navratra twice a day they conduct havans jaaps jagrata et al regularly sometime even multiple times a month our family does that too but not as often or at the same scale as them when they re not engrossed by their loud pujas however i can hear them yell at each other all day long they call each other names to the extent that d make a road rag blush nobody in our building therefore likes them one bit they re a nuisance not only to each other but to other families in the building too many of whom have impressionable little children this made me think what s the point of following any religion if it does nt bring you an iota of peace or does nt rid you of basic vices of jealousy intolerance harm to the fellow human and lack of empathy in general what would the cosmetic practice of religious rituals achieve in the long run if you are a progressively worse human being with every passing day and finally how can indian religions be reformed to make better humans out of us
2020-04-04 18:22:13
they do nt connect religious tenets to daily behaviour each religion has a ritualistic aspect and a moral advisory aspect it is common for people to focus on the former and forget the latter this is because identifying with a religion no longer means following moral tenets it means fulfilling the ritual aspects this shift has occurred with the growth of population and religious propagation
fuck every religion imma be atheists from now
let me step aside a bit and go on a tangent the boon and bane with indian religions at least with the collective we now term as hinduism is that there is no central authority or guiding figure ofc there are gurus for each sect which can sort of fulfill the gap and act as a potential figurehead but since the religion is so diverse that people have been interpreting it in their own way heck sometimes even between families the customs vary greatly also since there is no proof of eternal damnation like abrahamic religions folk are nt afraid of being judged it is basically upto you to be good worse comes to worse they think they will born as a bug or something in the next round coming back to the original question religions can and will never get rid of human vices cuz that is what makes us humans but it can keep it in check which almost all religions are advocating for the point according to the pooja practioner is to keep the gods happy and no matter what they do they will be forgiven this seems to be a major trait in all religions as far as indian religions are considered they need to unify and get under a common umbrella by unify i mean mentally and not only in fb groups and spew venom over other religions cut the caste divide intermarry blur it out there are a lot of spaces for improvement like the sikh brothers their sense of community is far greater than any other indian religion take care of local temples own them make community participate etc give easily digestable forms of scriptures to the young ones which gives them a sense of right and wrong from a ethical point of view and not a reward punishment view having said all this it is always difficult to contain what goes on inside a person s mind when he is down or angry spirituality will only help so much

preface this is my personal opinion and not an official statement from the government hi there i work with the government i m here to direct yall towards some sources which can help allay fears and make you help us help you the ministry of health and family welfare has frequent pressconference with the joint secretary ministry of health the director general dg of the indian council of medial research the dg of press information bureau the dg of the national informatics center and the joint secretary ministry of home affairs these updatesbriefingspress conferences answer questions from spread to ppes to production to logistics to even ministers claims updates on press conference on press conference on press conference on press conference on media briefing on media briefing on media briefing on day before yesterday the government shared statistics related to current stocks and future projections for procurements of masks ventilators ppes and medicine during the pm s meeting with all cms they are available here it also discusses speedy procurement it is available here daily updates are provided through the press information bureau either on their twitter or on their official website where you can sort by ministry of health or on their dailyupdated bulletin which amalgamates information from all union government sources some miscellaneous issues that i would like to address migrant workers while stuck in a difficult position are now being attended to by state governments using money from the state disaster management funds for room and board the lockdown is meant to buy time to formulate a postlockdown strategy ideally each state would have a mobile team of health workers who would attend to localised outbreaks of the virus eg nizamuddin in delhi the government has ramped up testing from on to on and is on its path to increasing further deriding the pm s exhortions towards appreciating essential workers or lighting a lamp is extremely immature do nt do it if you do nt want to i understand the slight that urban upper class privilege feels when asked to acknowledge the importance and significance of others especially those below them but both of the prime minister s requests serve essential needs clapping appreciating frontline workers who are risking the health of their families and themselves to stop the virus from spreading of course clapping is nt the only way of expressing your support and gratitude but no one forced you anyway any charges of the pm being a ringmaster and citizens being compliant monkeys stems simply from whatever latent insecurities you have lighting lamps in this unprecedented crisis each citizen is dealing with anxiety and deteriorating mental health many are away from their family many are going hungry engaging in a collective lamp lighting exercise gives hope it provides essential psychological comfort and a sense of security by displaying that all of us are together against this crisis finally i would say that in this time of national calamity and crisis it is our duty as citizens to come together in solidarity and work towards the national directive the best part is that the government operates on an iterative basis through feedback and consultation government notifications are amended based on petitions by citizens civil society and industry groups for example exempting the movement of all goods from earlier just essential goods so if you feel there is a problem reach out and make it known stay informed stay safe

please explain if the govt was aware of ppe shortages why was flights of ppe exported it was against who advisory why was a new fund setup and why is it not under rti how is criticism immature its the backbone of democracy also how did clapping in the streets show appreciation for the hcw who are at risk how does lighting candles promote unity the govt is asking frustrated masses stuck at home to be part of a ritual instead of providing a proper plan its for a lack of a better word jhumla
thanks for putting out all these facts and hence provide us with the point of view of the government more clearly although i still believe that when the pm of the largest democracy addresses his nation he should take sufficient steps to clear the fizz around lack of masks ventilators gloves low testing food reserves wages and salaries migration problems and so on instead of asking everyone to clap or light candles for example what arvind kejriwal is doing i really appreciate him for addressing the people of delhi about the steps taken by him so as to solve the problem and at the same time addressed the issues which are there ahead of him i believe this gives a better sense of responsibility among the citizens
original comment by any charges of the pm being a ringmaster and citizens being compliant monkeys stems simply from whatever latent insecurities you have selfawarewolves many are away from their family many are going hungry engaging in a collective lamp lighting exercise gives hope instead of feeding them we light lamps so much security what a wonderful idea when in other countries its community created in india we seem to be living to praise supreme leader s pr marketing and astrology teams all hail supreme leader the government is now doing what ngos have been doing the past month in karnataka yesterday they had a zoom call to help ngo s a week after the lockdown days later stop falling for propaganda i have friends working in these circles and it s a class one shitshow the government has no public policy that is effective to weather through this i apologize for the first quote being a bit aggressive as for acts of community solidarity being spontaneous and driven by the civil society maybe you are partially informed at least the uk s clapfornhs and clapfotcarers was driven by the uk s department of health social care i m not denying lapses and lacunae in the government s response i m highlighting the work done so far and how it is responsible for supplementing state government ngo and private efforts and initiatives also i m not sure how the dear leader diatribe ties in with the government s epidemic response actors across the chain the pm bureaucrats health workers ngos and even private individuals are doing their best to solve the crisis

some questions about the native language of indian muslims
do south indian muslims speak the local languages as their native language i believe many speak deccan urdu but is it the norm for deccan muslims and in north india do muslims and hindus living in the same speak the same dialect of hindustani like awadhi or mewari
2020-04-04 16:10:23
my south indian muslim friend speaks tamil as his native language he ca nt speak hindi or urdu to save his life
they generally speak their native language as mother tongue from wherever they are most north indian muslims who do nt have hindiurdu as their first language can speak hindiurdu to some extent those who have studied in a madrasah are also taught some basic arabic i believe as to deccani urdu or dakhini i believe that is only spoken by telengana muslims and some muslims in mysore south karnataka it is not that common at all among tamil or malayalee muslims
yes the muslims of east up speak bhojpuri hindi and urdu

vaping illnesses are linked to vitamin e acetate says cdc
well now that it s proven that vaping nicotine was nt responsible for the vape deaths in us which the people in icmr used as an unverified clickbait news to target vaping and to promote cigarette sales will anyone who matters voice their opinions to the icmr considering the fact that they re completely incompetent at handling the current pandemic and were completely incompetent from the fucking start
2020-04-04 15:49:28
it s too late now it s already banned and cigarettes sales have never been higher it was more of a business related ban than a health related ban literally no one died in india from vaping

movies last week saw a spanish movie called platform blew me away amazing directing editing and hard hitting storyline knives out got ta watch it it s more like murder on orient express but a really good egg was nt really impressed could be just because i really did nt like it much documentary the least expected day spanish it s on a cycling team called movistar just in awe of the effort the determination these guys have the team dynamics individual interests how everything sits together chernobyl time watch no words to explain except when the truth offends we lie and lie until we can no longer remember it is ever there but it is still there every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth sooner or later that debt is paid
tv shows the oa if you re into scifi here s a totally unique concept of nde timelines dark fans would love it cancelled after season by netflix the good place created by michael schur the sopranos oh man i m on season and i just ca nt stop watching it the role of tony soprano the lead character an italian gangster was the inspiration for creating iconic tv characters like walter white from breaking bad don draper from mad men the mood the scenes the tension not brainer the sopranos was voted no tv show to watch by almost all sites magazines

yes also the earth is flat was an inside job chemtrails they are making the frogs gay
source last reported date for quarantine numbers last reported confirmed cases made using qgis tool for windows fishy because there are more number of confirmed cases of in districts with low number of people under quarantine even accounting for the delhi tablighi meeting cases if foreigners were able to spread the diseases across india it s impossible that almost none of the persons under home quarentine in tamil nadu who also returned from abroad have not tested positive

amazing series i m a big fan of tvf series because they kinda give you feeling where you can relate to things the vibes the atmosphere same is the case with pitchers yeh meri family kota factory they always come up with amazing shows which are relatable and fun to watch acting character introduction everything was perfect i sometime wonder what would happen if any of their series is not able to excite the audience because expectations with tvf is very high among audience when i saw the trailer and jeetu i knew am gon na binge watch it on the first day because hey does nt like to watch tvf series episodes are small like somewhere between mins so overall wo nt take more than hrs if you binge watch few weeks ago i also watched an amazing series called asur it was way better than scared games and mirzapur
2020-04-04 13:27:52
i binged all episodes too it s a brilliant show that will hit close to home for many
if asur would have been produced by netflix then it would have been the most watched tv series in india by now amazing cast plot and even brilliant acting hats off to current production team

a cluster of coronavirus cases can be traced back to a single mosque and now million muslims are being vilified

2020-04-04 12:37:01
people are not just angry because they attened this event but despite the tamil nadu govt warnings they attened the event were foreigners participated but then instead of quaranteening themselves they conducted prayers roamed streets freely and potentially spread the virus to thousands and when almost everyone belong to a single group religion here people get irrational hatred that s what unfortunately happens in real world obviously doesnt make it right no one can help with that not even govt
to be fair it is nt just that it s the hiding spitting on doctors roaming naked in hospitals beating up the police and doctors coming to help them their religious leaders encouraging mass prayers on streets etc but this does nt mean that you label the whole community you ca nt use the worst part of a group to label the entirety of the group that is sheer stupidity the ones responsible should be punished whether they be muslim hindu or anything what so ever anyone not cooperating should be charged with attempts of mass murder cause that s what their behaviour would lead to eventually

banks are going to become a hotbed for corona virus infection situation will be more fatal than that of any religious gatherings
this is going to be long but it s necessary to put all facts clearly tl dr gov announces stupid dbt bankers are scared for dear life people are starting flocking banks in thousands possibility of infection rises exponentially many bankers and people are gon na get sick or die just want to direct some attention toward a section of essential service which is seldom talked about in good terms yet it stands at the forefront in this pandemic banks are open yes for a few days the timings were reduced to hours but timings are back to normal now all staff have been told to present in full strength and told to work amid the fear of contracting the virus most of you reading this may not have visited a bank branch located in semi urban or rural areas rusu the banking environment is vastly different in rural or semi urban branches as compared to metro or big cities branches semi urban branches are located at talukatehsil level and rural branches are located at rural places most people in urban areas use digital means to carry out their banking needs but that s not the case in rusu areas these rusu branches have huge footfall owing to the least digitally literate demographic residing in these areas bigger the psb greater the footfall amidst this lockdown bank people are told to work and keep essential services running such as cash transactions atm replenishment among others which is ok to an extent now here s the catch on one hand our pm asks people to stay at home to contain the spreading but on other hand fm launches a scheme called pm gareen kalyan scheme which announces some direct cash benefit to jan dhan women account holder as well as pensioners all this money is going to come in these accounts keep in mind that you ca nt expect people to act rationally especially in rusu areas now what is happening is that huge swathes of people have started visiting branches without checking their eligibility as they must have watched someone shouting in a random news channel about gov distributing money for bankers it brings back the haunted memory of demonetization crowd bank management has told the branch personnel to equip themselves with sanitizer masks as well as make sure people maintain proper distance first thing premises of most of these rusu branches is pathetic most of these are in dilapidated state and only a bunch of people can stand comfortably at a time in branch so it s not possible to handle the huge crowd that is swarming these branches combining with the fact that people are getting restless and anyone with a passbook is rushing pushing and shoving to get inside and near the counter only to be told that he is not eligible or the funds have not arrived yet a few bankers in a branch are expected to handle thousands in a day which is very tiring and depressing if you think about it but the main thing is it is impossible to maintain social distance among the crowd i mean how will you manage to maintain the social distancing among the crowd of so now a single person with virus will unknowingly spread it to hundreds among those thousands and then these hundreds will then infect their families needless to say that many bankers will contract the virus as they will be dealing with the cash the pass book among others one more thing it s not a one time exercise our great great fm has made sure that people come three times in three months to withdraw rs each time so that the lucky ones who got spared the first time get infected the other couple of times this is in my personal opinion such a bad decision that i literally have no words to explain the absurdity of it what s the purpose of lockdown when you are allowing crores of people to get out of their homes and gather at one place is it different than any religious gathering that s been a hot topic from couple of days now i am so aghast that no one is talking about it you may ask then what would these poor people eat if they do nt have money for this my answer would be people do nt eat money have the gram panchayat through pds distribute the food free of cost have people s medical need met free of cost through asha workers etc who resides in the villages i mean there are many alternatives to cash when people will have food to eat and health to be taken care of then they wo nt need to go outside and they will then be saving themselves and their community from the infection no need to emphasize that after doctors bankers right now are the second most vulnerable section to get infected but nobody hardly acknowledges that this is sad i am sure that this senseless decision of government will come back to bite them back and many people will lose their lives

this was not a study it was just a data analysis it not peer reviewed yet it is just spreading like fake news and well known news outlets are picking it up how can they use evolving data in the middle of a pandemic to predict definitive outcome of the same only projections can be made i saw something on news channel too the doctor also seemed very skeptical only news channels are repeating this on loop a controltest experiment is being undertaken in australia and that will take months to show results source
no we should trust this only if it is verified through clinical trials and sure the deaths may be fewer but the burden on the healthcare system and disruption to daily life is going to be greater and india mandated bcg only in the a lot of our grandparents would nt have got this vaccine as would have people in remote rural areas

will lighting a candle matter
it was the day of the nationwide lockdown imposed by the government to control the spread of coronavirus which began on march it was announced a day earlier that our honourable prime minister narendra modi will address the nation through a short video message everyone started anticipating what the message could be considering that when prime minister last addressed the nation he called for a nationwide lockdown but when the prime minister addressed the nation he urged on april at for all of us to stand on our doorway or balconies switch off the lights and for nine minutes light a candle diya torch or your mobiles with an aim to fight the darkness spread by coronavirus with light he further said if everyone lights one diya each then we will realise the power of that light we will be able to highlight the objective for which we all are fighting together he also requested everyone not to assemble in roads and maintain social distancing he also appreciated people for setting an example of discipline and service prime minister also said that when millions of people are enclosed inside their homes there must be some who must be asking how can they alone fight this battle against we are not alone this is the power of crore people this awareness gives us motivation gives us a goal and gives us the energy to achieve them it further clears our path friends amidst this darkness caused by coronavirus epidemic we need to constantly pursue to reach towards the light this was undoubtedly one of the shortest messages of prime minister barely lasting minutes and it surprised many when they expected a more actionoriented announcement rather than a symbolic gesture as lighting a candle we must recall the earlier symbolic call for people to thank everyone involved in fighting the coronavirus on of march by clapping for them when the prime minister clearly mentioned that the reason for the call for this symbolic gesture was solely to dispel the darkness caused by the epidemic this was not enough for most of us to find alternative reasons behind this we humans have a high tendency to fill in the blanks when there is not much information available regarding an issue many linked numerology behind and minutes assuming that the prime minister chose the date and time after considering all the astrological logic behind it numerous social media posts were immediately created and shared widely and at the same time there were sceptics to voice their views saying that instead of gimmicks government must concentrate on practical ways to fight the pandemic also some people who always believed that the prime minister imposed his religious beliefs reasoned that he stressed the number which holds its very own religious significance and asked not to step out of the house for the socalled demonic exercise below is one such social media post which was widely circulated among the certain community be it navaratri or navagrahas is a significant part of hinduism they also believe that the mother goddess waged a war for days against the rakshasas for deliverance hence the number and the belief that by lighting diyaa candles for mins everything will go away mr modi has earlier too asked all indians to bang their plates n glasses in appreciation for the medical professionals which again had a hindu belief attached to it to ward off evil he is a religious leader for many but we have a spiritual author n perfector in christ jesus and hence church pls do not fall prey and step out of your homes for this demonic exercise be wise and learn to read between the lines stay in your homes let your lights be on and have a good time of family prayer from on april and make sure you exceed mins there is no denying the fact the government and health care workers ought to do the practical things necessary to fight the spread of coronavirus and moreover the government must support the people impacted by the hardships due to the lockdown however it is also true that we must not forget that a person can be killed not only by the virus but also due to the negativity that we are surrounded by with the way the information that comes their way about the havoc caused by the coronavirus there are many people who get very depressed people die being depressed and their numbers are often not counted the way the people that are dying due to coronavirus it is said that your state of mind changes when you change your physiology there are many physical ways to do the same as exercise declarationincantationaffirmation music and lighting a candle dia is no doubt one such way to change our state of mind many of us would be constrained to do any other activity right now and there is no doubt that this symbolic gesture is a simple thing that we can do along with our countrymen showing solidarity against the challenge that we are fighting against it is your own choice whether to do it or not and you can also fill the gap by saying that it is not in sync with your religious beliefs whatever be the reason and even if the prime minister called for this exercise after considering various factors as being alleged i don t see any harm in doing what he asked us to do what harm will it have if you light a candle i can not digest any messages of conspiracy theories in this regard the only harm i can foresee is if you have too much hand sanitizer in your hand while lighting the candle or dia most of us would have stayed in their homes for the past days and it is quite natural for people to feel depressed and uncertain about what the future has in store for them the most anyone can do to fight the coronavirus is do nothing and stay in the house let us kill the virus called negativity at the same time when we fight coronavirus stay home stay safe
2020-04-04 08:00:36
i do nt think the problem is with lighting a candle or diya or flashing torch light it has its own merit and message behind it which is pretty good gesture to show solidarity but what has happened is the pm is just asking us to do such things whereas not communicating anything about the action plan the status updates on corona the testing scenario have we tried enough to procure ppe and make for our doctors where and how it the pm cares fund being utilised and so on as a result of not communicating about the action plan on how to make the current situation better and just asking us to clap bang thalis and flash torchlight has created a negative perception about the pm has raised questions on his and his teams credibility when you do nt talk about the issue in hand but talk about lighting diyas personally i do nt think it s the right approach it makes you question what the leadership is actually doing why are they shying away from talkin about the issues in hand in times of crisis it is very very crucial to be transparent and communicate more than usual which i do nt think we as indians are seeing and hence all that remains is clap bang thalis and flas torchlight
i agree i do nt see any reason to criticize it it s intended to spread positivity nothing wrong in that
lighting a candle clapping balcony concerts etc as we ve seen around the world are absolutely lovely and human and sure are great for mental health but people themselves should organise it like everybody did in other countries the pathetic thing is that a pm is instigating it instead of concentrating on real work it s just smoke and mirrors from his part social media pr gag

musings of a bored quarantined doctor
i work in one of the big private hospitals treating covid in delhi one of our nursing staff turned positive i shared a shift with him and had a chat for an extended period now i m quarantined bored and a little scared was playing around with whatsapp status in the morning making fun of the policies how when we need more medical supplies and personal protection equipment to save lives the government is making arrangements for the end with keeping you locked up close to family and showing you ramayana some people had a problem with that ended up arguing with me of which turned into a fight both of them either told me that i should nt be complaining or the way i am criticising about is wrong both of them ended up telling me how i think similar to jamat people and how i should just shut up and do my job also how everybody else is doing their jobs and making india proud while i m just criticising one of them ended up attacking me personally and hence i blocked him and the other one ended up blocking me since i was nt respectful of the elders i thought i was just expressing my scepticisms and was being creative but supposedly even working hard under lifethreatening conditions avoidable does nt give you the right to criticise the government ツ also yes even private hospitals have shortages of protective equipment edit words

you are already doing a great job during this shit storm thanks a lot for that
welcome to india any criticism of the govt is considered antinational i really wish the central government was a lot more forthcoming about different steps being taken to contain the spread honestly the state governments are doing a much better job central government is doing only photo ops hmm looks like i have digressed also thank you for your effort in this fight against
i hope you told them that if they god forbid someone in their family got would they take that relative to a doctor or to an astrologer or to a doodhwala to drink gaumutra if they answer doctor tell him that s the reason why they need a doctor because india has a massive shortage of doctors it takes years to become a doctor we can not replace doctors immediately

2020-04-04 07:14:26
content wise absolutely hotstar the app sucks big time
yes for the content it provides per year is a cheap price
a year is worth it for its hbo content alone everything else on top just makes it an unbeatable streaming platform purely on roi imho appwebsite experience is overrated when you are watching a movieshow in fullscreen which is what you would be doing of the time the experience hardly matters as long as its in hd

photography is all about light and shade next composition and then subject some might say subject is important but without first two it wo nt be a striking photograph you got the light and shade aspect down the composition could use some work since there is no balance between the cloud and moon both equally important subjects in your frame keep at it learnmore about composition and lighting from the vast resources available on the net

tiktok whatsapp videos being used to mislead people on coronavirus cops written by neeta sharma updated april am ist new delhi from videos advising people not to follow social distancing rules to those suggesting muslims are immune to coronavirus the delhi police say they have uncovered a concerted misinformation campaign that poses a serious challenge to the government s efforts to contain the ongoing pandemic in an investigation of the content being shared on whatsapp and apps like tiktok in the first week of the nationwide lockdown the delhi police said they have found many of the videos specifically targeting the muslim community by quoting religious text and leaders an analysis of more than videos on the social networking over the last five days found that most of the fake information and posts are created in hindi and urdu for a specific audience the police said the videos were analysed by the police with the help of security researchers fact checkers and data analysts and a report on the digital investigation has been accessed by ndtv according to early estimates more than crore people have already seen these videos suggesting a high degree of circulation and impact several of these videos appear to be shot in pakistan and middle east but audio in hindi has been superimposed to make it look like its shot in india the report which the delhi police has shared with various intelligence agencies says our analysis has revealed an alarming number of videos are being shared advising muslims not to practice social distancing and several suggesting that coronavirus does not kill muslims a senior police official said according to him the analysis also revealed a pattern in dissemination of misinformation while analysing the origins and sources of these videos it was observed that several of the accounts which originally created them are being deleted regularly after the content goes viral to hide its origin he said considering the fact that most of these videos have been created with professional video editing software being viralled sic on social media platforms original uploader accounts being deleted and certain accounts peddling fake news among muslims are promoting pakistani religious leaders with terror links a further investigation into the likely role of foreign actors needs to be investigated the report says according to the investigation chineseowned video sharing app tiktok is the most preferred medium for creating and spreading videos with religious instigations against health advisories and fake information regarding the coronavirus these videos are further being shared on whatsapp facebook and twitter videos of muslims refusing to get themselves tested and beating medical personnel were being spread and others were also being encouraged to do the same the report says religious texts are being quoted to not stop shaking hands and people are being encouraged to go to their religious shrines even during lockdown it adds authorities have expressed concern about the impact of these videos amid attacks on medical personnel like in madhya pradesh s indore this week and the emergence of a cluster in delhi because of a gathering held by a muslim missionary group last month that has spawned dozens of cases across the country in the investigation into the delhi congregation the police are looking into a sermon allegedly by the chief cleric of the group tablighi jamaat that termed the directions of doctors as a conspiracy to keep muslims away from fellow muslims since then maulana saad kandhalvi has officially issued an audio message to his followers asking them to cooperate with the government to fight the disease we have to take precautions follow the guidance of the doctors and give full support to the government such as not crowding into places this is not against the principles of islam he said while at around cases and deaths the spread of coronavirus in india is far more limited than in europe and the us health experts have warned that the numbers could surge across the country if the contagion takes root
atleast this one has been debunked
saw this on my group of old friends the dude deleted the text the moment he knew it was fake the hatred for muslims is spreading faster than a forest fire

jobless graduate here stop trying so hard would have been better if u joined a top tier college than iit tbh
brother going to hit you with the old cliche marks and grades do nt mean much this is partly true it has been years since i left college and i sometime think i should have done masters or phd but as you said i was pretty sure i didnt want to do engineering or management i was into computers and i wanted to do masters in ocean tech applied for colleges out of india but was nt accepted in the one i wanted so i gave up but do nt worry about a job now ur quants score is too good and no doubt you will do good in any iim and land a job later also there are always iim aspirants who go to these quant classes you can take up a teaching job there they pay a decent amount i had a friend who was working full time software he hated it and part time was teaching at an institution and years after our ug he applied for iim and joined it so take a break join a job maybe move cities get a fresh perspective on life and take a decision you got this
first stop criticizing for all your efforts man it s commendable that you worked hard for this it s ok you did nt get what you desired but you tried your best i know this sounds vague but there are people who have not even given their best and still frying like a idiot maybe life is preparing your for something much better but hard work is not the only way to success it s good to work hard if you enjoy the work keep working do nt loose hope fuck the economic situation winners will always find a way have this attitude in your head brother
