first tried to use praw, but found that it can only get 1000 results, which amounts to ~3 days of data on r/india
Using another api pushshift, able to search posts by date, but it had the following problem:
	pushshift unlike praw is not using reddit api directly, pushshift instead captures a post
	when it is initially posted. This means that if the post changes, these changes are not captured by the api
	for example if it is removed by moderators, automod removes it, it gets deleted, has missing/ incorrect flair etc.
So I went for a hybrid approach:
	1. Use pushshift to get results by searching for posts after a date, iterating over date(s)
	2. Use praw to get current status of the post by getting it's url from pushshift
	3. if valid, get data from praw
